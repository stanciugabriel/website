# Why Rust

# Let's see some code


<v-click>


```c

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

void printBinary(uint32_t num) {
    for (int i = 31; i >= 0; i--) {
        printf("%d", (num >> i) & 1);
        if (i % 8 == 0) printf(" ");  
    }
    printf("\n");
}

int main()
{
    uint8_t a;
    uint32_t b;

    a = 0x01;
    b = a << 24;

    printBinary(a);
    printBinary(b);

    return 0;

#### &nbsp;&nbsp; Solution

```c
b = (uint32_t) a << 24;
//b will be 00000001 00000000 00000000 00000000  
//same result on any architecture and compiler;

# Variables in C

```c

#include <stdio.h>

int8_t, uint8_t
int16_t, uint16_t
int32_t, uint32_t


```

# Variables in Rust

```rust
u8, u16, u32, u64, u128
i8, i16, i32, i64, i128
usize // word size (eg - 32b for 32b processor)
isize // word size (eg - 32b for 32b processor)

//NOTES:
char // 4 bytes != u8 //UTF-8 not ASCII like in C
b"str" // ASCII string (slide)
"str" // UTF-8 string (slice)

's' // char
b's' // u8 (ASCII char)
```

# How do we keep C++ code functional in safety-critical applications?

Lots of tooling and processes

Coding standards / restricted subsets: MISRA C/C++, AUTOSAR C++14, SEI CERT C/C++, JSF AV C++ (plus documented deviations/waivers).

Static analysis & compliance checking: rule checkers + dataflow analyzers (e.g., Polyspace, Coverity/CodeSonar/Parasoft, clang-tidy) integrated in CI.

Compiler hardening & build gates: warnings-as-errors, stack protection, fortified libc checks / hardening bundles (e.g., _FORTIFY_SOURCE, -fstack-protector-strong, -fhardened).

Dynamic bug finding (test builds): sanitizers for memory/UB/races (ASan/UBSan/TSan), plus coverage-guided fuzzing (libFuzzer).

Safety evidence overhead: mandated reviews + traceability + V&V activities (ISO 26262 / DO-178C / IEC 61508-style workflows).

# Why Rust - some tech insights

### The tagline of Rust is No Undefined Behavior. 

- no null reference; the Rust compiler explicitly asks developers to check
this;
- no implicit cast, even adding a `u32` to a `u8` must be casted;
-  safe access to shared data across threads verified at compile time;
- uses type states to move runtime checks to compile time and force
developers to check;
- clearly defined data types, unlike `int` or `long`;
- safe unions, that provide a safeguard to prevent wrong interpretation
of data;
- clear code organization into crates and modules;
- backward compatibility at crate level.

# Does Rust remove the need for tooling?

No, but it sure makes code safer and dev faster 

Rust’s advantage is biggest in safe Rust.

As unsafe/FFI grows, assurance shifts back to: unsafe policy & reviews, FFI boundary correctness, sanitizers/fuzzing on risky edges, dependency/toolchain governance; plus the same ISO/DO-178 traceability & V&V.

[Rust in Android: move fast and fix things](https://thehackernews.com/2025/11/rust-adoption-drives-android-memory.html) 

- A 1000x reduction in memory safety vulnerability density compared to Android’s C and C++ code
- With Rust changes having a 4x lower rollback rate and spending 25% less time in code review, the safer path is now also the faster one
