# Embassy Setup

Here, we will cover the steps needed in order to be able to compile and flash Rust applications for **STM32U545** and **RP2**s, the MCU (Microcontroller Unit) found in our **STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q** and **Raspberry Pi Pico** boards.

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

## Prerequisites

### Rust Toolchain

In order to install the tools needed to compile Rust code, follow the next steps, depending on your operating system.

#### Linux

Run this command in the terminal:

```shell
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

This downloads and runs `rustup-init.sh`, which in turn downloads and runs the correct version of the `rustup-init` executable for your platform.

:::info 

Before installing elf2uf2-rs, you need to install  `pkg-config` and `libudev`. You can install them by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libudev-dev
```

:::

#### Windows

Download the respective executable:

* [RUSTUP-INIT.exe - 64bit](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/x86_64-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe)
* [RUSTUP-INIT.exe - 32bit](https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup/dist/i686-pc-windows-msvc/rustup-init.exe)

:::note
You may be prompted to install [Visual Studio C++ Build tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/). If so, follow the instructions from the previous link.

Even if Visual Studio is already on your machine, `rustup` will not verify if the required components are present. If you experience issues with the `rustup` installation on Windows, please follow [these instructions](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html#installing-only-the-required-components-optional) to manually add the missing components.
:::

The last step is to run `rustup --version` in terminal. If everything went well, you should see an output similar to this:

```shell
rustup 1.26.0 (5af9b9484 2023-04-05)
info: This is the version for the rustup toolchain manager, not the rustc compiler.
info: The currently active `rustc` version is `rustc 1.76.0 (07dca489a 2024-02-04)`
```

### `elf2uf2-rs`

This tool is needed to be able to program the board over USB. In order to install it, run the following in your terminal:

```shell
cargo install elf2uf2-rs
```

Then, run `elf2uf2-rs --help`. If it was correctly installed, you should see something similar to this in your terminal:

```shell
Usage: elf2uf2-rs [OPTIONS] <INPUT> [OUTPUT]

Arguments:
  <INPUT>   Input file
  [OUTPUT]  Output file

Options:
  -v, --verbose  Verbose
  -d, --deploy   Deploy to any connected pico
  -s, --serial   Connect to serial after deploy
  -h, --help     Print help
```

### `probe-rs`

This tool is an embedded debugging and target interaction toolkit. It enables its user to program and debug microcontrollers via a debug probe.

```shell
cargo install probe-rs-tools --locked
```

If you are on **Linux** you will also need to add this [`udev`](https://probe.rs/files/69-probe-rs.rules) file in `/etc/udev/rules.d`. Then, run:

```shell
udevadm control --reload # to ensure the new rules are used.

udevadm trigger # to ensure the new rules are applied to already added devices.
```

### VSCode Extension (Optional)

For a better experience, go ahead and install the **Debugger for probe-rs** extension in the Microsoft Extension Marketplace. This will make debugging the program running on the RP2040 as easy as debugging a Rust program running on your host machine.

## Flashing over USB

### Compiling

You will need to compile your executable specifically for the target chip. The **RP2040** is based on the **ARM Cortex‑M0+** architecture, while the **STM32U545** and **RP2350** are based on the more powerful **ARM Cortex‑M33** architecture. In each case, we will need to specify the correct target when compiling. We can do that in multiple ways:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="stm32u5" label="STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q" default>
* using a `.cargo/config.toml` file:

```toml
[build]
target = "thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf"
```

* passing it as a parameter to Cargo:

```shell
cargo build --release --target thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf
``` 
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="rp2350" label="Raspberry Pi Pico 2" default>
* using a `.cargo/config.toml` file:

```toml
[build]
target = "thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf"
```

* passing it as a parameter to Cargo:

```shell
cargo build --release --target thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf
```
  </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="rp2040" label="Raspberry Pi Pico" default>
* using a `.cargo/config.toml` file:

```toml
[build]
target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"
```

* passing it as a parameter to Cargo:

```shell
cargo build --release --target thumbv6m-none-eabi
```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


### Flashing

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="stm32u5" label="STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q" default>
For the STM32U545, flashing is typically done through its built‑in **DFU (Device Firmware Upgrade) mode** or via a **debug probe** such as ST‑LINK. To enter DFU mode, you usually hold the **BOOT0** pin high while resetting the device, which makes it appear as a USB device to your PC. Once in this mode, you can flash new firmware without repeatedly plugging and unplugging the USB cable. Many development boards also include a reset button to simplify this process.
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="rp2350" label="Raspberry Pi Pico" default>
To flash a program to the Raspberry Pi Pico via USB, it needs to be in *USB mass storage device mode*. To put it in this mode, you need to **hold the `BOOTSEL` button down**  while connecting it to your PC. Frequently connecting and disconnecting the USB cable can damage the port, so we conveniently attached a reset button on the breadboard included on the **Pico Explorer Base**. Now, to make it reflashable again, just press the two buttons simultaneously.

After connecting the board to your PC and compiling the program, locate the binary in the `target/thumbv6m-none-eabi/release/` folder then, run:

```shell
elf2uf2-rs -d -s /path/to/your/binary
```

* `-d` to automatically deploy to a mounted pico
* `-s` to open the pico as a serial device after deploy and print serial output
  
:::note
On `Windows`, you may need to run this command in a terminal that has **Admin Privileges**.
:::
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


## Debugging using Raspberry Pi Debug Probe

In order to be able to debug the program running on the board, we will need to connect the **Raspberry Pi Debug Probe** to our **Raspberry Pi Pico W**. Below is a picture of the provided debug kit:

![Raspberry Pi Debug probe](assets/the-probe.png)

To connect them, we will use the **3-pin debug to 0.1-inch header (female)** cable. First, carefully insert the **3-pin debug** head in the **right side** connector. Then you will also need to connect it to the Raspberry Pi Pico W. You can find the pinout below, take a closer look at the bottom of the image:

![Raspberry Pi Pico W pinout](assets/picow-pinout.svg)

The connections must be:

| Wire | Raspberry Pi Pico W |
|-|-|
|TX (Orange)|SWCLK|
|GND (Black)|GND|
|RX (Yellow)|SWDIO|

:::warning
Do not forget to connect both the Debug Probe and Pico to your PC.
:::

Now, you can either debug using the command line by running:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="stm32u5" label="STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q" default>
```shell
probe-rs run --chip STM32U545RETxQ path/to/your/binary
```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="rp2350" label="Raspberry Pi Pico 2" default>
```shell
probe-rs run --chip RP2350 path/to/your/binary
```
  </TabItem>

    <TabItem value="rp2040" label="Raspberry Pi Pico" default>
```shell
probe-rs run --chip RP2040 path/to/your/binary
```
  </TabItem>

</Tabs>


or you can use the **Run and Debug** view in Visual Studio Code. You will need to modify the `programBinary` path in the `.vscode/launch.json` config file to point to your binary file.

## Building your first Embassy project

In this section, we will briefly go over the steps you need to take in order to get your first project using **Rust** and **Embassy** going.

### Creating your crate

The first step is to create your cargo package by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
cargo new --vcs none embassy
```

* `--vcs none` because at the moment we do not want to use any code versioning (they are useful, but this is not the purpose of this tutorial)

### Crate settings

Because we are running in an embedded environment, our code needs to be *"tailored"* specifically for the microcontroller we intend to use. In our case, it is the **STM32U545** and **RP2**s, but these general steps apply for any chip, produced by any manufacturer.

#### No standard library

Due to the size constraints imposed on us (in our case, `2MB` of flash memory), the standard library has to go. We specify that by adding the `#![no_std]` attribute to the beginning of our `src/mains.rs` file.

#### No `main` function

Because we are using the **Embassy** framework, we want to let it take care of the entry point of our program (because it has to do some complex operations, like allocating the `task-arena` and `executor` structures). For the moment, all we will need to do is add the `#![no_main]` attribute to `src/main.rs`.

#### Toolchain setting

Our chip can be one of several Cortex‑M families, and we need to specify the correct target triple when compiling. The **RP2040** is a **Cortex‑M0+** that uses the **ThumbV6‑M** architecture, while the **Raspberry Pi Pico 2** and the **STM32U545** are both **Cortex‑M33** devices that use the **ThumbV8‑M.main** architecture. We will do that using a `rust-toolchain.toml` file, as it allows us to also set the toolchain release channel we will use, and the components we require.

An example of such file is this:

##### rust-toolchain.toml

```Toml
# This file is used to specify the version of the Rust toolchain that 
# should be used for your project.

[toolchain]
# The release to be used.
channel = "1.90"
# The targets for compilation that need to be added. This is used for 
# cross-compilation, as the executables we are producing need to be
# run on our boards.
targets = ["thumbv6m-none-eabi", "thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf"]
# The additional componets to be installed along the Rust toolchain
components = ["rust-src", "rustfmt", "llvm-tools", "clippy"]
```

:::tip

We can use the same `rust-toolchain.toml` file for both the **RP2350** and the **STM32U545**, we just need to make sure to add both  **target triples**. The RP2040 is a Cortex-M0+ that uses the `thumbv6m-none-eabi` target while the RP2350 and STM32U545 are both Cortex‑M33 devices, so they use the `thumbv8m.main-none-eabi` target.

:::


<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="stm32u5" label="STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q/Raspberry Pi Pico 2" default>
Please make sure that you install the Rust ARMv8-M target (thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf).

```bash
rustup target add thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf
```

:::info
You can skip this step when the target is defined in `rust-toolchain.toml`.
:::

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="rp2350" label="Raspberry Pi Pico" default>
Please make sure that you install the Rust ARMv6-M target (thumbv6m-none-eabi).

```bash
rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
```

:::info

  </TabItem>

#### Memory layout

We also need to take care of the memory layout of our program when writing code for a microcontroller. These can be found in the datasheet of all the microcontrollers. Below, you can find the memory layout for the **STM32U545** and **RP2**s:

##### `memory.x`

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="stm32u5" label="STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q" default>
```ld
MEMORY

  /* On-chip Flash memory */

  /* On-chip SRAM (SRAM1+SRAM2+SRAM3 combined) */
  RAM (rwx)  : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 256K
}
```

:::info
You don’t need to provide a `memory.x` file when using **Embassy**, because the `embassy-stm32` crate has a feature called `memory-x`
that already supplies the required linker script.

:::info
You don’t need to provide a `memory.x` file when using **Embassy**,  
because the `embassy-rp` crate has a feature called `memory-x`
that already supplies the required linker script.
:::

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

To use the `memory.x` layout file, we will also need to use a build script. Rust facilitates that through the `build.rs` file. Below you will find an explained build script you can use.

##### `build.rs`

```rust
//! This build script copies the `memory.x` file from the crate root into
//! a directory where the linker can always find it at build time.
//! For many projects this is optional, as the linker always searches the
//! project root directory -- wherever `Cargo.toml` is. However, if you
//! are using a workspace or have a more complicated build setup, this
//! build script becomes required. Additionally, by requesting that
//! Cargo re-run the build script whenever `memory.x` is changed,
//! updating `memory.x` ensures a rebuild of the application with the
//! new memory settings.

use std::env;
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::Write;
use std::path::PathBuf;

fn main() {
    // Put `memory.x` in our output directory and ensure it's
    // on the linker search path.
    let out = &PathBuf::from(env::var_os("OUT_DIR").unwrap());
    File::create(out.join("memory.x"))
        .unwrap()
        .write_all(include_bytes!("./memory.x"))
        .unwrap();
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-search={}", out.display());
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed={{layout}}");

    // `--nmagic` is required if memory section addresses are not aligned to 0x10000,
    // for example the FLASH and RAM sections in your `memory.x`.
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg=--nmagic");

    // The `link.x` linker script provided by `cortex_m_rt` (minimal runtime for
    // Cortex-M microcontrollers used by embassy) will include our `memory.x` memory layout.
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg=-Tlink.x");

    // The `link-rp.x` linker script provided by `embassy_rp` that defines the
    // BOOT2 section.
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg-bins=-Tlink-rp.x");

    // The `defmt.x` linker script provided by `defmt`.
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-arg-bins=-Tdefmt.x");
}
```

:::info

If you are using the `memory.x` provided by `embassy` comment this part:

```rust
    let out = &PathBuf::from(env::var_os("OUT_DIR").unwrap());
    File::create(out.join("memory.x"))
        .unwrap()
        .write_all(include_bytes!("./memory.x"))
        .unwrap();
    println!("cargo:rustc-link-search={}", out.display());
    println!("cargo:rerun-if-changed={{layout}}");
```

:::

#### Adding the Dependencies

At this step, we must add the dependencies we will use for our project. Below you will find the basics you will need for a minimal application, including an `usb_logger` to *"enable"* debugging over serial.

##### `embassy-executor`

This is an `async/await` executor designed for embedded. To add it as a dependency to your project, run:

```shell
cargo add embassy-executor --features arch-cortex-m,executor-thread,executor-interrupt,integrated-timers,task-arena-size-32768
```

* `arch-cortex-m` - feature to specify we are running on the cortex M architecture
* `executor-thread` - enable the thread-mode executor (using WFE/SEV in Cortex-M, WFI in other embedded archs)
* `executor-interrupt` - enable the interrupt-mode executor (available in Cortex-M only)
* `integrated-timers` - use the executor-integrated embassy-time timer queue.
* `task-arena-size-X` - sets the task arena size

We will also need to add the `cortex-m` and `cortex-m-rt` crates as dependencies, as the `#[executor::main]` attribute depends on the minimal startup code for the Cortex M microcontrollers found in these crates. To do that, run:

```shell
cargo add cortex-m
cargo add cortex-m-rt
```

##### `embassy-time`

This crate enables timekeeping, timeouts and delays. Add it by running:

```shell
cargo add embassy-time
```

#### `embassy-stm32`

This crate is a **Hardware Abstraction Layer** for the **STM32U545**. You can add it to your project like so:

```shell
cargo add embassy-stm32 --features time-driver-any
```

* `time-driver-any` - enable the timer for use with `embassy-time`.

#### `embassy-usb-logger`

USB implementation of the `log` crate. It allows the usage of `info!` macro and some more. To add it, run the following command:

```shell
cargo add log
cargo add embassy-usb-logger
```

### `panic-probe`

This crate adds a panic handler for the microchip that prints panic messages over **JTAG**, and in order to add it, run:

```shell
cargo add panic-probe
```

### The code

Here you can find a minimally explained code that prints `"Hello World!"` over the serial interface:
