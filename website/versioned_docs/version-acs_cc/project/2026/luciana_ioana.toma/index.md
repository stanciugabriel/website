## Description

BreatheCheck is an embedded monitoring device built on the STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q board. The project combines gas sensing, environmental sensing, and optical heart rate and SpO2 sensing in order to provide a broader view of the air being breathed and the user's basic physiological indicators.

For gas detection, the device uses an MQ-3 sensor. Its analog output is read through the STM32 ADC and compared to a baseline measured during startup calibration. The firmware estimates an alcohol-related gas concentration in mg/L based on how much the MQ-3 value rises above the clean-air baseline. A deadband is used so that normal breath humidity and temperature do not immediately trigger a false alcohol reading.

The BME280 sensor measures ambient temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. These values are displayed together with the MQ-3 reading in order to provide environmental context, since gas sensor behavior can be influenced by surrounding air conditions.

For heart rate and SpO2 monitoring, the MAX30102 optical sensor measures reflected red and infrared light from a fingertip. The firmware processes the raw samples using a simple peak detection algorithm to estimate heart rate in BPM, and uses the red/infrared signal ratio to estimate SpO2.

All values are shown on a 0.96" SSD1306 OLED display. Three LEDs provide quick feedback for the MQ-3 alcohol-related level: green for normal, yellow for caution, and red for exceeded threshold. A passive buzzer is activated when the red threshold is reached.

The prototype is powered through the STM32 Nucleo USB connector. The firmware is written in Rust using embassy-rs.

The alcohol, BPM, and SpO2 values are estimated for educational and demonstration purposes. The device is not intended for medical, legal, or safety-critical use.

## Motivation

I chose this project because I wanted to work with multiple sensors at the same time and learn how to handle analog, digital, and I2C peripherals in Rust using embassy-rs.

Instead of building only a simple breath alcohol detector, I wanted the device to monitor several values related to breathing and air conditions: alcohol-related gas concentration, temperature, humidity, pressure, heart rate, and SpO2. This made the project more interesting because it combines environmental sensing with basic biometric sensing.

The project was also useful for learning how to combine several sensor readings into one embedded application, display live values on an OLED screen, and provide immediate visual and audio feedback through LEDs and a buzzer.

## Architecture

The project is divided into several sensing, processing, and feedback blocks that work together to monitor breath-related gas concentration, environmental conditions, and biometric values.

Main Components:
* **The Controller**: The STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q board — the brain of the device. It reads all sensors, processes the data, updates the display, and controls the LEDs and buzzer.
* **The Gas Sensing System**: The MQ-3 gas sensor is connected to the ADC and is used to detect alcohol-related volatile compounds in exhaled air. The firmware calibrates the sensor against the surrounding air at startup.
* **The Environmental Sensing System**: The BME280 sensor measures temperature, humidity, and pressure. These values describe the surrounding air conditions and provide context for the MQ-3 reading.
* **The Optical Sensing System**: The MAX30102 sensor is connected over I2C and estimates heart rate and SpO2 from a fingertip using red and infrared light.
* **The Display and Feedback System**: The SSD1306 OLED displays the live measurements. Three LEDs and a passive buzzer provide immediate feedback based on the MQ-3 alcohol-related threshold.
* **The Power System**: The prototype is powered through the STM32 Nucleo USB connector during operation and debugging.
