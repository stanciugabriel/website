## Description

The project is an interactive foosball game designed for a dynamic two-player experience. Each player uses a custom-built remote controller to command their digital striker on the field. The strikers are powered by stepper motors and move along the OX axis to position themselves  and execute rapid striking maneuvers to kick the ball.

Using a set of arcade-style buttons, players can move their striker left or right to block shots and trigger a strike action to score a goal. The system features a distributed architecture, where a central STM32 master coordinates the movement while two Raspberry Pi Pico units handle player input and real-time scoring updates on OLED displays. To ensure reliability and precision, the machine is equipped with infrared sensors to automatically detect goals.

This project combines hardware engineering and real-time control into a fun, high-speed test of player coordination.

## Motivation

I wanted to create an interactive project that I could test and enjoy with my classmates. After researching various concepts, I was inspired by a unique foosball mechanism I discovered on social media.

## Architecture

The project uses a modular design where different parts work together to control the game and track the score in real-time.

**Main Components:**

* **Processing Units**
  * STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q: This is the main controller. It handles the game logic and monitors all sensors at high speed.
  * Raspberry Pi Pico H: These boards manage the buttons and screens for the players. They send player inputs to the STM32 and update the displays based on the information received back.

* **Movement & Action**
  * Attacker Mechanism: This part uses stepper motors and linear rails. The motors are connected to the STM32 through A4988 drivers, which translate digital signals into precise physical movement.

* **Sensors & Feedback**
  * Goal Detection: Infrared sensors are placed in the goals. When the ball passes, the system automatically updates the score.
  * OLED Displays: Small screens that show the current score.

* **User Controls**
  * Arcade Buttons: High-quality buttons that players use to move and shoot. They are designed for fast and repeated use.

## Log

### Week 6 April - 12 April

* Thought about the game concept and made a first list of needed parts.

* Looked into how the players should move and kick.

### Week 13 April - 19 April

* Checked if the STM32 and Pico work well together.

* Figured out how to link the controllers to the main board.

* Decided to use buttons instead of joysticks for better control.

### Week 20 April - 26 April

* Ordered all the necessary electronic components and hardware parts.

* Sent the custom-designed slider parts for 3D printing to begin the mechanical assembly.

### Week 27 April - 3 May

* Completed the hardware setup for both controllers: mounted the displays, wired the buttons and soldered the USB-C ports.

* Configured UART communication between the STM32 and both Raspberry Pi Picos. I verified that button signals are received correctly and that the STM32 sends updates to be displayed based on the attack button presses.

### Week 4 May - 10 May

* Assembled the game table and worked on its design.

* Assembled the movement mechanism and connected everything to a 12V power source.

* Connected IR sensors to each gate so that they would display the correct score on the screens when they detect the ball.

### Week 11 May - 17 May

* Completed the attack and movement mechanics.

### Week 18 May - 24 May

* Tested and improved the movement and overall gameplay.

## Hardware

The system uses one main controller (STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q) and two secondary boards (Raspberry Pi Pico H) to handle the game smoothly.

* **Main Controller (STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q)**: This is the brain of the project. It runs the game logic and tells the motors how to move. It communicates with the player boards using UART communication via physical USB-C connectors and sends signals to the motor drivers.

* **Player Boards (Raspberry Pi Pico)**: Each player has a Pico board. Its job is to read the Arcade Buttons and show the score on the OLED screens.

* **Motors & Movement:** I use NEMA 17 motors with a GT2 belt system to move the players. Linear bearings and steel rods make the movement smooth.

* **Sensors:** IR Sensors are placed in the goals. When the ball passes through, the sensor sends a signal to the STM32 to increase the score.

* **Power Supply:** A 12V adapter powers the motors. I use an LM2596 converter to change 12V into 5V for the controllers.
