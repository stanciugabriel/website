## Description

Smart Bin is a trash bin that automatically sorts waste without any user intervention. When it detects a hand nearby, it opens a flap and lets the object fall onto an internal analysis platform. There, humidity, metal, and weight sensors analyze the object and classify it into one of three categories: wet, dry, or metal. A motor then rotates the container platform until the correct one is in position, after which the object is released. If a container is full, the system refuses to accept new waste for that category.

## Motivation

My motivation to tackle this project came from my daily commute to work. Every day, before getting on the metro, I would buy a coffee cup and something to eat. Sometimes, if the metro was in the station, I hurriedly threw the cup and the food wrapper in the nearest trash bin, without looking for the correct label. So while I was searching for a project idea, I remembered that it would be nice to have a trash bin that could automatically sort the waste, without me having to worry about it.

## Architecture

Smart Bin is built around an STM32U545RE-Q Nucleo board that coordinates all sensors and actuators through firmware written in Rust with Embassy.

**Main flow:**

1. The proximity sensor detects a hand at the entry and the first servo opens the entry flap
2. The object falls onto the analysis platform where the following are read simultaneously:
   - humidity sensor
   - metal sensor
3. Based on the readings, the microcontroller classifies the object as WET / DRY / METAL
4. If the container is available: the stepper motor rotates the turntable to the correct position, the second servo releases the object
5. The display shows feedback to the user about the classification result and if a container is full or not
6. The fill level of the containers is checked (one infrared sensor per container)


**Interfaces used:**
- SPI: ST7735 LCD Display
- PWM: servo × 2
- GPIO: stepper motor, metal sensor, infrared reflective sensors × 3
- ADC: humidity sensor

## Log

### Week 5 - 11 May
I bought the hardware components, and mapped out the pin connections. I started testing each component with simple and minimal code. 

### Week 12 - 18 May
I completed the initial testing for each component, and presented them to the lab assistant.

### Week 19 - 25 May
I started integrating the components, and writing the main logic for the project. I also assembled the final version for PM Fair.
