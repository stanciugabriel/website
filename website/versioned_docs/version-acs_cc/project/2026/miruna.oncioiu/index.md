## Description

The project is a Bluetooth-based robotic system consisting of a 2-wheeled mobile car and a dedicated handheld remote. Both units utilize STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q microcontrollers. The remote reads joystick inputs to transmit directional data, while the car processes these signals to drive two DC motors. The system also integrates a ToF sensor for distance monitoring and an OLED display for real-time telemetry.

## Motivation

I chose this project to implement a robust Master-Slave communication link between two embedded devices. By building a custom remote controller instead of using a mobile app, I was able to manage the full data pipeline: from analog joystick acquisition to UART Bluetooth transmission and PWM motor execution.

## Architecture 

The system architecture is divided into two main hardware-software modules:

1. **Remote Controller Unit**
   - **Input**: Analog Joystick (X/Y axes).
   - **Processing**: ADC sampling and packet serialization.
   - **Output**: Bluetooth TX (Commands).

2. **Mobile Car Unit**
   - **Input**: Bluetooth RX (Command parsing).
   - **Processing**: Movement logic and motor speed calculation.
   - **Output**: PWM for Motor Driver, I2C for OLED and ToF Sensor.

## Log

### Week 13 - 19 April
- Project planning and component acquisition.
- Setup of the Rust development environment for STM32.
- Mechanical assembly of the 2-wheeled chassis with a ball caster.

### Week 20 - 26 April
- Soldered header pins for the motor driver, OLED, and ToF sensor.
- Verified power delivery from the 4xAA battery pack.
- Completed 1st version of the documentation.

### Week 27 - 03 May
- Configured GPIO pins and basic PWM channels for driving the L298N motor controller.

### Week 04 - 10 May
- Connected the SSD1306 OLED display via I2C using the `embedded-graphics` library.
- Integrated the VL53L0X Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor.

### Week 11 - 17 May
- Developed the async UART communication tasks for the HC-05 modules.

## Hardware

The hardware architecture features two STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q boards configured in a Master-Slave setup for synchronized control. The Remote Controller acts as the Master, reading analog joystick positions via ADC and transmitting serial commands through an HC-05 Bluetooth module. The Mobile Car serves as the Slave, parsing UART strings to drive two DC motors via an L298N H-Bridge using PWM signals. Additionally, the system integrates an SG90 servomotor to sweep a VL53L0X ToF sensor for distance monitoring, providing real-time visual feedback on an SSD1306 OLED display via the I2C bus.
