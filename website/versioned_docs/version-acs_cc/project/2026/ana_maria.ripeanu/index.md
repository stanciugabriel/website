## Description

The project is a mobile robotic crane designed to move and manipulate objects using a multi-DOF arm equipped with an electromagnetic gripper. The system is controlled wirelessly via Bluetooth, allowing the user to drive the platform and position the arm to pick up and place objects. Before gaining control, the user must authenticate using an NFC tag, which is read by an RFID module and validated by the system. This ensures that only authorized users can operate the crane, combining interactive control with a basic access control mechanism.

## Motivation

I chose this project because I’ve always been interested in construction systems, an interest that started in childhood when I wanted to become an architect. Initially, I planned to build a tower crane, but after some brainstorming I decided on a robotic arm-based crane instead, as it seemed more interesting and allowed me to explore more complex control and interaction mechanisms.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 30 March - 5 April

Explored multiple project ideas and decided on the concept to be developed.

### Week 13 - 19 April

Ordered the hardware components.

### Week 27 April - 3 May

Assembled the project and did the wiring.

### Week 4 - 10 May

Finished the hardware.

### Week 11 - 17 May

Finished the software. I had a few issues communicating throught the bluetooth module, but I found out it was a hardware issue.

<!-- ### Week 19 - 25 May -->

## Hardware

The project uses a STM32 Nucleo-U545RE board as the main microcontroller. A motor driver shield (L293D-based) is used to control four DC motors for the platform. The robotic arm is actuated using multiple servo motors (MG995 and SG90), while an electromagnet module is used for object manipulation. A Bluetooth module (HC-05) enables wireless control, and an RC522 RFID module is used for NFC-based user authorization. An RGB LED provides visual feedback. The system is powered by a 5V supply and assembled on a custom 3D-printed structure.
