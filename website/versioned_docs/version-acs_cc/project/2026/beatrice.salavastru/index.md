## Description

A laser harp system with 8 laser beams acting as strings. Each beam is aligned with a phototransistor. When the user interrupts one of the beams, the STM32 detects the event and plays the corresponding note through a speaker.

## Motivation

As someone interested in both music and technology, I want to build an interactive system that translates physical gestures into sound. This project allows me to explore working with optical sensors, handling real-time input from multiple sources, and generating audio signals on a microcontroller. It also gives me the opportunity to integrate hardware and software into a complete system, while creating a visually engaging and intuitive user experience.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 April
Designed and built the wooden frame for the laser harp. Planned the layout of laser beams and sensors to ensure proper alignment and stability.

### Week 12 - 18 April
Ordered all hardware components from TME and Sigmanortec. 

### Week 4 - 10 May
Built and tested the electronic circuit using a simple test program. The goal of this stage was to verify that the laser modules, phototransistors, STM32 inputs and audio amplifier worked correctly before integrating the final software.

### Week 11 - 17 May
Implemented the sample-based audio playback system. The project was changed from simple frequency generation to playback of RAW audio samples stored directly in the STM32 Flash memory. The system now works as a standalone instrument: the audio is played directly through the speaker, without depending on a USB connection to the laptop for sound generation.

## Hardware

The project is built around the **STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q**, which reads the sensors and controls the audio output.

The physical harp uses 8 laser modules, each aligned with a phototransistor. The phototransistors are connected to GPIO pins configured as external interrupt inputs. When a laser beam is interrupted, the corresponding input changes state and the STM32 detects the event as a string trigger.

For audio output, the STM32 generates a high-frequency PWM signal on `PB3 / TIM2_CH2`. This signal is passed through a simple analog filtering stage and then sent to an **LM386 audio amplifier**, which drives an 8Ω speaker.

The structure is mounted on a custom wooden frame that keeps the lasers and sensors aligned.
