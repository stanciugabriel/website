## Description

This project is a Bluetooth-controlled smart fishing boat built using an STM32 microcontroller programmed in Rust.  
The boat can be controlled using a Bluetooth HC-05 module. It uses two independent DC motors for movement and a servo motor to open a bait container and release the fishing bait.

## Motivation

I chose this project because I wanted to combine embedded systems with real-world robotics.  
A fishing assistant boat is a practical and fun application of microcontrollers, motor control, and mechanical actuation.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](./diagrama.svg)

The system is composed of the following main components:

- STM32 microcontroller (main control unit)
- Motor driver module (controls 2 DC motors)
- Two DC motors (propulsion system)
- Servo (catapult mechanism)
- Power supply (battery system)

### How they connect:

- STM32 sends PWM signals to motor driver → controls movement
- STM32 controls servo signal → triggers catapult
- Battery powers all components through power distribution circuit
