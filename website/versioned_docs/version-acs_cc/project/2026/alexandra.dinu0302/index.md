## Description

The device dispenses pills from a 7-day rotating carousel according to a preset schedule. A stepper motor rotates the pill box to the correct day, while a second stepper motor controls a shutter disc that opens to release pills by gravity. An IR sensor confirms dispensing, a Hall sensor verifies carousel position, an ultrasonic sensor detects user proximity, and a temperature/humidity sensor monitors storage conditions. The user sets schedules via 3 buttons and an OLED display. A servo motor locks the lid to prevent unauthorized access. All dispensing events are logged to a MicroSD card.

## Motivation

Elderly people and patients with complex treatments frequently forget to take their medication on time. Commercial automated dispensers are expensive and often lack verification mechanisms. This project provides an affordable solution that verifies every step of the dispensing process through multiple sensors, monitors storage conditions, and alerts the user through audio and visual feedback — all without requiring internet connectivity.

## Architecture 

![Architecture Diagram](architecture.svg)
The system has three main subsystems connected to the STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q:

- **Sensor subsystem** — 4 sensors provide feedback: Hall effect (KY-035, ADC) for carousel homing, IR obstacle sensor (GPIO) for pill detection, HTU21D (I2C) for temperature and humidity, HC-SR04P (GPIO) for user proximity detection.
- **Actuator subsystem** — 3 actuators control dispensing: Stepper motor 1 + ULN2003 (GPIO×4) rotates the carousel, Stepper motor 2 + ULN2003 (GPIO×4) controls the shutter disc, Servo SG90 (PWM) locks/unlocks the lid.
- **Interface subsystem** — OLED SSD1306 display (I2C), DS3231 RTC (I2C) for scheduling, MicroSD card module (SPI) for event logging, active buzzer (PWM) for alarms, 3 push buttons (GPIO) for menu navigation.

All I2C devices (OLED, DS3231, HTU21D) share the same bus on PB6/PB7 with 4.7kΩ pull-up resistors. Communication protocols used: I2C, SPI, GPIO, PWM, ADC.

## Log

### Week 4 - 10 May
The hardware components arrived, and I immediately began testing them individually to verify their basic functionality on the breadboard.

### Week 11 - 17 May
I successfully interconnected all the hardware modules and developed the initial part of the software architecture using async Embassy tasks.

### Week 18 - 24 May
Finalize the software implementation, calibrated the sensor thresholds, and completed the overall structural design for the final demonstration.

## Hardware

The mechanical assembly uses a commercially available 7-day round pill box mounted upside-down on the first stepper motor's shaft. The compartments face downward onto a fixed base plate. A second stepper motor drives a shutter disc beneath the base — when the shutter hole aligns with the active compartment, pills fall through by gravity into a collection tray. A neodymium magnet glued to the carousel triggers the Hall sensor once per revolution for position calibration. The IR sensor at the dispensing window confirms that pills actually fell through. The entire assembly sits inside a box enclosure containing the breadboard, STM32 Nucleo, battery holder, and all electronics.
