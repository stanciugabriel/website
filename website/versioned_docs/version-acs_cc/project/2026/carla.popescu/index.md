## Description

A laser-based smart access control system built on the Nucleo-STM32U545RE-Q board, programmed in Rust using the Embassy async framework. The system uses a KY-008 laser module aimed at an LDR photoresistor to detect intrusions. When the beam is interrupted, a red LED and an active buzzer are triggered as an alarm. Access control is handled via an RC522 RFID module — scanning a valid MIFARE card grants a 5–10 second window during which the laser can be interrupted without triggering the alarm. Scanning an invalid card three consecutive times locks the system and activates a continuous alarm, which can only be silenced by an admin-level card. All status messages (cardholder name, "Access Granted", "Access Denied") are displayed on an SSD1306 OLED screen.

## Motivation

I was inspired by a YouTube video of an analog laser alarm circuit and wanted to recreate it in a more modern, complex, and functional way using embedded Rust. The project gave me the opportunity to explore real-time embedded programming with Rust and Embassy, while building something that has real practical value — a low-cost security system suitable for protecting small spaces such as rooms, drawers, or storage areas. Unlike a simple PIR motion sensor, the laser beam creates a clear, visible security barrier that makes the system easy to understand and deploy. The added RFID access control layer transforms a simple alarm into a complete, realistic security system.

## Architecture

![Arhitectura sistemului](images/diagrama_pm.drawio.svg)

The **Nucleo-STM32U545RE-Q** is the central control unit, coordinating all components through an async state machine implemented in Embassy:

- The **KY-008 laser module** emits a continuous red beam (650nm, 5V) aimed at the **LDR photoresistor**. The LDR value is read via ADC and compared against a baseline calibrated at startup. A sudden drop in value signals beam interruption.
- The **RC522 RFID module** communicates via SPI at 3.3V. It reads MIFARE Classic 1K card UIDs, which are matched against a hardcoded list of authorized users and admin cards.
- The **SSD1306 OLED display** (128x64px) communicates via I2C and shows real-time system status: idle, access granted/denied, alarm active, or system locked.
- The **red LED** signals an active alarm; the **green LED** signals a successful access grant or system idle state.
- The **active buzzer**, driven by a BC547 NPN transistor (controlled via GPIO at 3.3V, powered at 5V), sounds the alarm when triggered.

The system operates as a state machine with the following states:
- **IDLE** — laser active, monitoring
- **ACCESS_GRANTED** — valid card scanned, grace period active (5–10s)
- **ALARM** — beam interrupted without valid access
- **LOCKED** — 3 consecutive invalid card scans, continuous alarm until admin card scanned

## Log

### Week 5 - 11 May
Gathered all the necessary components and set up the development environment 
(Rust + Embassy). Started with the basic hardware setup: connected the laser 
module and LDR to the breadboard and verified the ADC readings. Implemented 
the software baseline calibration for the LDR.

### Week 12 - 18 May
Integrated the SSD1306 OLED display over I2C and the RC522 RFID module over 
SPI. Implemented the access control logic: admin card recognition, grace 
period, and wrong attempt counter. Connected the buzzer via PWM.

### Week 19 - 25 May
Finalized and tested all components together. Assembled everything into a box 
for the presentation. The laser beam, alarm, RFID access control, and OLED 
display all work correctly together.
