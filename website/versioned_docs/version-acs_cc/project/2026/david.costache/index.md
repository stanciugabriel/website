## Description
VERIT-SCAN is a non-destructive fresh fruit quality analyzer that fuses measurements from four independent physical domains — aroma (VOC + humidity), firmness (elastic deformation under controlled force), apparent density (mass / laser-estimated volume), and electrical conductivity — into a single Overall Quality Score. The results are displayed locally on an OLED screen with RGB LED feedback and streamed via UART to a host PC for logging and plotting.

## Motivation
Fruit quality assessment is traditionally subjective: we squeeze, sniff, and judge by appearance. These signals are real but hard to quantify, compare across samples, or log over time. VERIT-SCAN replaces subjective judgment with four quantifiable measurements drawn from distinct physical domains — chemistry (VOCs), mechanics (elasticity), geometry + mass (density), and electrochemistry (ionic conductivity). The project is an exercise in multi-sensor data fusion: no single sensor tells the whole story, but together they build a meaningful quality score. It also explores a non-destructive approach to firmness testing, replacing the traditional penetrometer (which damages the sample) with an elastic-deformation measurement that leaves the fruit intact.

## Architecture 
The system is structured around an async embedded runtime (Embassy on STM32U545) with the following architectural components:

- **Sensor Acquisition Layer** — four concurrent async tasks, one per measurement channel:
  - *Aroma Task* — reads BME680 over I²C every 500 ms (VOC resistance + humidity)
  - *Firmness Task* — orchestrates the VL53L0X + HX711 interaction (baseline distance → force ramp → final distance)
  - *Density Task* — combines HX711 weight reading with VL53L0X height estimation
  - *Conductivity Task* — samples the internal ADC (14-bit) on the electrode divider
- **Fusion & Scoring Layer** — a coordinator task that collects readings from the four acquisition tasks via Embassy channels, normalizes each raw value to a 0–100 score based on calibrated per-fruit-type thresholds, and computes the weighted Overall Quality Score.
- **Presentation Layer** — three parallel output tasks:
  - *Display Task* — renders scores on the SSD1306 OLED using embedded-graphics
  - *Indicator Task* — drives the RGB LED via PWM (green/yellow/red mapping) and the buzzer at measurement completion
  - *Telemetry Task* — streams a JSON line per measurement on UART2 (exposed as ST-Link Virtual COM Port) to the host PC
- **Host-side Plotting** — a Python script (pyserial + matplotlib) running on the PC parses the JSON stream and plots all four scores + the overall score in real time.

Data flow: Sensors → Acquisition Tasks → (Embassy Channel) → Fusion Task → (Embassy Channel) → Display / Indicator / Telemetry Tasks.

## Log
### Week 5 - 11 May

I have assembled the hardware components on a breadboard and started prototyping the software architecture. Unfortunattely, the sensors weren't soldered properly, which caused a delay and force me to redo the wiring.

### Week 12 - 18 May

I have securely mounted the hardware components onto their dedicated support structure, ensuring a clean, organized, and nice layout. The setup now features proper cable management and perfectly aligned sensors, giving the physical prototype a polished, final look. With the hardware architecture completely stabilized and visually refined, my focus has now shifted to the software development phase. I am currently writing and testing the firmware.

### Week 19 - 25 May
During this final week, I focused on system stabilization and achieving a polished, professional finish for the prototype.
I completed the core firmware integration, ensuring reliable data acquisition from all sensors (HX711, BME680, and ADC).
Successfully integrated the buzzer and RGB LED logic, creating a clear feedback system for fruit quality assessment.

## Hardware
The core of VERIT-SCAN is a **NUCLEO-U545RE-Q** board, built around the STM32U545RE (ARM Cortex-M33, 160 MHz, 512 KB flash, 272 KB SRAM) with an integrated ST-Link V3 debugger. The board exposes four I²C buses, two UARTs, a 12-bit ADC, and a 14-bit ADC — the latter is used for the DIY conductivity channel, where two stainless-steel electrodes in contact with the fruit flesh form a voltage divider with a 10 kΩ precision reference resistor.

Three digital sensors share a single I²C bus: **BME680** (VOC + humidity + temperature + pressure), **VL53L0X** (time-of-flight laser distance, used both for firmness-via-deformation and for height/volume estimation), and an **SSD1306 0.96" OLED** for local display. An **HX711** 24-bit ADC interfaces the 1 kg load cell, which is used both for weighing and for monitoring the controlled force applied during the non-destructive firmness test. User feedback comes from a common-cathode **RGB LED** driven by three PWM channels and a passive **buzzer** driven by a timer PWM. Communication with the host PC uses **USART2**, exposed transparently as a Virtual COM Port through the on-board ST-Link, so no external USB-to-UART adapter is needed.
