## Description

The project is an autonomous runaway alarm clock designed to eliminate oversleeping. Unlike traditional devices, this clock uses a dual-sensor array to manage its environment: one sensor dedicated to detecting the user's approach and another for active obstacle avoidance.

It uses real-time proximity data to distinguish between the user trying to silence the alarm and physical barriers like walls or furniture. By requiring the user to physically get out of bed to chase and capture the fleeing device, the project ensures that the user is fully awake through forced movement and environmental interaction.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is to combat oversleeping by replacing the easily ignored "snooze" button with a physical activity that forces the user to wake up. I chose this specific application because it provides a practical way of learning how to process real-time sensor data within a dynamic, real-life environment, requiring the software to make navigational decisions based on live feedback to achieve a reliable "flee" response.

## Architecture 

Main Architectural Components:
1. User and Obstacle Detection (Input Data):
   - Role: Monitors surroundings to detect the user of pottential obstacles it may find in its way.
   - Components: 2x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors. One is towards the user (rear side of the robot) and the other is towards the front.
   - Logic: Signals are passed through a voltage divider (2K/1K resistors) to translate the 5V echo pin into 3V3 signals the board can accept.
2. The Central Logic Controller (Processing):
   - Role: The board executes the code logic, manages real-time interrupts from the sensors and calculates movement directions.
   - Async Task Manager: Uses asynchronous programming to simultaniously handle the alarm timing, sensor signals and motor adjustments without blocking the CPU.
3. Escape System (Output):
   - Role: Responsible for the physical movement of the clock.
   - Components: L298N Driver and 2x DC Motors.
   - Control Logic: The board sends PWM signals to the EnA/EnB pins to control the speed and digital signals to pins IN1-IN4 to set the direction.
4. Audio System (Output):
   - Role: Provides an alarm sound that forces the user to interact with the device.
   - Components: Passive Buzzer.
   - Logic: It is triggered by GPIO pins when the internal RTC matches the set alarm time.
5. Power Network:
   - Role: Power the circuit accordingly to each component's needs.
   - Logic: 1x external battery power the STM32 board and 4x AA batteries power the motors.
6. Remote Control System (Input):
   - Role: Allows the user to stop the alarm remotely.
   - Components: Infrared Receiver and Remote Control.
   - Logic: The receiver is connected to the board and listens for signals from the remote to trigger the alarm stop function.
7. Visual Indicator System (Output):
   - Role: Provides a visual countdown before the alarm goes off.
   - Components: 3x LEDs.
   - Logic: The LEDs light up in sequence to indicate the time left until the alarm is triggered.
