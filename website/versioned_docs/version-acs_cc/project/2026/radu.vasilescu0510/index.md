## Description

The Randomness-audited Wheel-of-Fortune is an arcade-like
product, designed to be fun and interesting. The user chooses the number of full rotations,
presses the “start game” button and the wheel begins to rotate. When it stops, the result is displayed on the LCD screen,
along with fairness statistics. The project uses an entropy source - the jitter from an
unconnected analog pin – to create a carnival experience. At the same time,
fairness is guaranteed by the chi-square test and the distribution of the results is
logged on an SD card for external audit.

## Motivation

I am interested in how mathematics can be
used in practical contexts and the wheel-of-fortune shows exactly that.
Probabilities and statistics have applications in domains such as economics,
physics, gambling, etc. Therefore, they are one of the most straightforward
ways to show that mathematics is not only about theory, but also about
real-life situations.

## Log

### Week 27 April - 3 May

I created the documentation, containing a lot of details about the
project.
### Week 10 - 17 May

I created the motorized wheel and presented a spin demo
for the hardware milestone. Also, I wired the pot and the button.

### Week 18 - 24 May

I wired the SD card reader, the EEPROM and the LEDs.
I implemented most of the required software and presented a demo for the software milestone.

### Week 25 - 31 May

I replaced the DC gear motor and VNH2SP30 driver with a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor and ULN2003 driver, which lets the wheel land exactly on the target slot without speed/brake calibration. I added a 16x2 LCD (4-bit mode) that shows the result and the chi-square fairness verdict after each spin, moved the start button to an analog input, and repurposed the potentiometer to select the number of full rotations.


## Hardware

The hardware architecture revolves around the STM32 microcontroller. The physical rotation of the wheel is powered by a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor controlled via a ULN2003 driver, which gives exact, repeatable positioning on the target slot without any speed or brake calibration. The system is powered via a 5V USB connection. User inputs are handled by a 50k potentiometer to configure the number of full rotations and a physical push button (read as an analog voltage level) to start the game. A 16x2 LCD displays the resulting slot and the fairness verdict after each spin. The AT24C256 I2C EEPROM is used for stats logging. The MicroSDHC 8GB card and the SD card reader nano module are used for external audit. All components are prototyped and connected using a standard 830-point breadboard and a dedicated jumper wire set.

## Software

The software architecture is written entirely in **Rust**, utilizing the **Embassy** asynchronous execution framework. This allows the microcontroller to handle multiple concurrent tasks—such as driving the stepper motor, managing user inputs, and logging data to the SD card—without blocking the CPU.
