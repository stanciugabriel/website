## Description

My project consists in building a mini Slot Machine where you can insert coins and bet X amount of credited money. The system uses a load cell to count coins and three stepper motors to physically roll the reels. The game is initiated via a dedicated Spin button, and if the player wins, the amount is dispensed physically using a servo-driven payout mechanism.

## Motivation

I wanted to do something fun and help students control their gambling addiction with tiny amounts of money.

## Architecture

The software architecture is based on a Finite State Machine (FSM) managing the game flow, implemented in Rust using the Embassy framework for async multitasking.

 - The main components (architecture components, not hardware components):
   - **Core Logic / State Machine**: manages game states (`IDLE`, `WAITING_FOR_BET`, `SPINNING`, `PAYOUT`) and coordinates all modules.
   - **Input / Sensor Manager**: handles debouncing for the Spin and Bet buttons and interprets weight signals from the load cell.
   - **Random Number Generator (RNG)**: responsible for the fair generation of the spin outcome.
   - **Motor / Actuator Controller**: translates the RNG result into steps for the 3 stepper motors and PWM signals for the payout servo.
   - **Display / UI Controller**: manages the ST7735 LCD, displaying credit balance and bet amount.
   - **Payout Manager**: commands the servo motor to eject the coins.
 - How they connect with each other:
   - The Input Manager detects a coin (weight increase) or a button press and sends an event to the Core Logic.
   - Core Logic updates the credit and instructs the Display Controller to refresh.
   - When the Spin button is pressed, Core Logic switches to the `SPINNING` state and requests a value from the RNG.
   - The Motor Controller starts the 3 stepper motors and stops them sequentially based on the RNG result.
   - If a win is detected, the Payout Manager activates the servo to slide coins out of the storage tube.

## Hardware

The build uses a microcontroller board driving a small TFT display, an HX711 + load cell pair for detecting inserted coins by weight, three 28BYJ-48 stepper motors with ULN2003 drivers for the physical reels, a continuous-rotation servo for the payout mechanism, arcade buttons for player input, and a 5 V stabilized power supply to handle motor peak currents.
