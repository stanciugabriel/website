## Description

The project is an **Air Defense Turret** designed for continuous environment scanning and target interaction. The system is built around an STM32 Nucleo microcontroller, coordinating a dual-axis positioning system: a stepper motor that performs a 0° to 359° horizontal sweep and a servomotor for vertical pitch control. A YS-27 Hall effect sensor is integrated to precisely detect the position where the rotational sweep must stop.

Distance detection is handled by a Time-of-Flight sensor, providing high-precision mapping as the turret pans. The system operates autonomously, identifying targets within its scanning arc and triggering a mechanical solenoid strike upon detection. Real-time system data and target telemetry are displayed on an integrated TFT screen. To ensure stable operation, the turret includes a dedicated power management circuit designed to handle the high-current requirements of the solenoid and drive motors.

This project combines hardware engineering and automated sensing into a high-speed demonstration of real-time response.

## Motivation

The project started with the idea of building a radar that identifies objects on a digital display. I was fascinated by the process of mapping sensor data onto a screen, but I wanted to push the complexity further. To challenge myself, I moved beyond simple monitoring and added a launch mechanism, transforming a passive radar into an active turret that physically reacts to its environment.

## Architecture 

The project is built like a team where every part has a specific job, all coordinated by a central processor to keep the movement smooth and the firing accurate.

Main Components:

* **The Controller**: An STM32 Nucleo board acts as the central processor. It monitors sensors, processes user input and coordinates all motor movements.
* **Power Supply**: A 12V source is distributed into two specific rails: 
    * 12V for the stepper motor;
    * 5V for the logic circuits, servo and sensors.
* **The Aiming System**: Enables dual-axis motion using a Stepper Motor for horizontal rotation (Pan) and a Servomotor for vertical positioning (Tilt), while a Potentiometer allows for manual calibration and fine-tuning.
* **The Sensors**: A Distance Sensor provides real-time ranging data.
* **The Endstop**: A YS-27 Hall effect sensor is used to find the exact position where the rotational sweep must stop.
* **The Trigger**: A Solenoid Piston handles the mechanical firing. It is controlled via a MOSFET, which allows the microcontroller to safely switch the high-current 12V load.
* **The Display**: A TFT Screen provides a real-time interface.

* I resolved the solenoid issue to ensure the correct launch distance and force for the projectile.
* I integrated the YS-27 Hall effect sensor to precisely detect the stopping position for the rotational movement.

### Week 25 - 27 May
* I finished the code implementation for the project.

## Hardware

The project integrates high-performance components to achieve autonomous detection and response. The STM32 Nucleo acts as the brain, processing data from the VL53L1X ToF sensor to map the environment. Motion is handled by a Nema 17 stepper motor for precise horizontal scanning and an MG996R servomotor for manual vertical adjustment via a potentiometer. A YS-27 Hall effect sensor is integrated to precisely detect the position where the rotational sweep must stop.

To handle physical action, an IRF520 MOSFET triggers a solenoid piston. The entire system is powered by a 12V 5A source, stabilized by a LM2596 buck converter. Visual feedback is provided by a ST7789 TFT display, showing real-time radar telemetry.
