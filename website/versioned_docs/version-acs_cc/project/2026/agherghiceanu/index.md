## Description

This project is a bluetooth controlled spider robot that you can sync up to your phone/tablet. From your device you can control it's speed,direction of travel and issue it extra gestures and commands, such as a wave. 

## Motivation

From a young age, I have been interested in robots and the process of building them. Futhermore, I have been following the
progress of boston dynamics projects for a long time, so I knew that I wanted to build a quadraped robot myself. When I recently
watched the movie Project Hail Mary, I decided that a spider is the best shape for my project to take.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->
### Week 16 - 22 March

Decided on the project idea


### Week 13 - 19 April

Ordered the necessary hardware components.

### Week 20 - 26 April

All hardware components arrived. 

## Week 27 April - 3 May

Started writing the documentation and modifying the source chasis to fit my components.

### Week 5 - 11 May


Finalized source chasis and printed the first version in order to start test-fitting components.

### Week 12 - 18 May

Tested all individual components, finalized the second version of the chasis and started writing the software required to run the robot.

### Week 19 - 25 May

Completed and uploaded the main portion of the software, with only minor addition left if time allows. Also performed first complete assembly to confirm everything fits correctly.


## Hardware

The main brain of the project is the STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q microcontroller provided by the PM team. This takes the input from the HM-10 Bluetooth module and processes it into a signal the i2c controller can then give to the PCA9685 Servo Driver. From there, the signal is passed on to the 8 servomotors that power our robot spider, 2 in each leg. The system is powered by a 1000mAh 7.4v LiPo 2 cell batery and will be built on a modified version of the chasis of the Sesame spider-robot linked in the link section.
