## Description

This project is an autonomous chess board powered by an STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q microcontroller. The board uses a system of two stepper motors to move an electromagnet along the X and Y axes beneath the board, allowing it to physically move chess pieces (which contain small magnets) without human intervention. An LCD display shows the current piece being moved and its legal moves.

The board implements a chess engine in Rust that computes valid moves and executes them automatically, moving pieces physically on the board.

## Motivation

I chose this project because it combines multiple engineering disciplines: mechanical design, electronics, and software. A self-playing chess board is a fascinating challenge that requires precise motor control and complex game logic — all implemented in Rust on an embedded system. It is a project that is both technically challenging and visually impressive, making it a perfect showcase for the knowledge gained throughout the semester.

## Architecture

### System Architecture

The system is composed of the following main modules:

- **STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q**: The main microcontroller that runs the chess engine, controls the motors, reads the Hall sensors, and drives the LEDs and LCD.
- **XY Motion System**: Two stepper motors (one for each axis) move a carriage beneath the board. An electromagnet mounted on the carriage attracts and moves the magnetic chess pieces.
-**LCD Display**: A 16x2 I2C LCD displays the current piece being moved and its legal moves.
- **Power Supply**: A 12V external power supply powers the stepper motors and electromagnet. A voltage regulator steps down to 5V for the logic components.
