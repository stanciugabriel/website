# Description
This project implements a two‑wheel self‑balancing robot built entirely using **Rust** on an **ESP32** microcontroller.  
The system uses an **MPU6050** IMU to measure tilt angle and angular velocity, while a pair of **156:1 Metal Gearmotor 20D×44L mm 6V CB** motors provide actuation.  
A PID control loop written in Rust continuously adjusts motor speed to maintain balance.

The robot is designed as a compact demonstration of real‑time control, embedded Rust programming, and sensor‑driven actuation.  
Optional BLE communication can be added using the `esp-radio` and `trouble-host` crates, enabling wireless telemetry or remote control.

# Motivation
I chose this project because I wanted to explore real‑time control systems using Rust.  
Self‑balancing robots are a classic challenge that combine physics, control theory, and embedded programming into a single, elegant system.

Unlike traditional Arduino‑based balancing robots, this project demonstrates that Rust can be used for precise timing, safe concurrency, and low‑level hardware access.

The robot is intended as a prototype for future small‑scale reconnaissance robots — a compact ground‑based drone that is harder to detect — but it can also be a fun educational platform.

# Architecture

## Main Components

### Sensing Layer
- **MPU6050 IMU**  
  Measures pitch angle and angular velocity using accelerometer + gyroscope fusion.

### Control Core
- **ESP32 running Rust**  
  Executes the PID loop, reads IMU data over I²C, and drives the motors using PWM.  
  Optional BLE support via `esp-radio` + `trouble-host`.

### Actuation Layer
- **Two 156:1 Metal Gearmotor 20D×44L mm 6V CB motors**  
- **Motor driver** for direction and PWM speed control

### Power Layer
- **2× 18650 Li‑ion cells**  
- **Buck converter** for stable 5V logic power  
- Motors powered directly from battery rail for high current capability

# Component Connection

### Sensor Link (I²C)
Connects the MPU6050 to the ESP32 and provides real‑time angle and angular velocity data.

### Control Loop (Rust + PID)
Runs at a fixed update rate.  
Combines IMU data with PID output to compute motor commands.

### Execution Link (PWM/GPIO)
Connects the ESP32 to the motor driver.  
Controls motor speed and direction.

### Optional Wireless Link (BLE)
If enabled, uses:
- `esp-radio` for radio stack  
- `trouble-host` for BLE host  

Allows telemetry or remote control.
