## Description

My project simulates a school entrance control system. An LED array imitates a student walking toward the gate. When the student reaches the barrier and scans their RFID card, the STM32 checks if the ID is authorized — if yes, the servo opens and the OLED displays the student name and entry time. If the card is unknown, a buzzer beeps and the red LED turns on.

## Motivation

I chose this project because access control systems are widely used in offices and schools, and I wanted to understand how they work from the hardware side. It also gave me the opportunity to work with multiple components and communication protocols simultaneously.

## Architecture 

* **MFRC522 (RFID Reader)** — Reads the student card ID via SPI and sends the data to the STM32.
* **STM32** — Main controller that verifies the ID and coordinates all system outputs.
* **Servo Motor SG90** — Actuator that opens the barrier via PWM when access is granted.
* **OLED Display** — Shows student name and entry time via the I2C interface.
* **LED Array** — Visual indicator that simulates student movement toward the gate.
* **Buzzer + KY-029 LED** — Feedback system: Buzzer and Red LED for "Access Denied", Green LED for "Access Granted".

## Log

### Week 5 – 7 

Brainstormed project ideas and defined the concept of an RFID-based school access system. Researched required components and planned the overall architecture.

### Week 7 – 8 

Discussed the project with the lab assistant. Selected key components (RFID reader, servo motor, OLED display) and set up the development environment.

### Week 19 – 25 May

Started implementation:

* connected and tested the MFRC522 RFID reader
* implemented card detection and ID reading
* set up communication between peripherals (SPI, I2C, GPIO)
* began integrating the OLED display for showing student data
* tested basic servo control for gate simulation
