## Description

A 4 legged spider robot controlled via a Flutter mobile app over WiFi with a TCP server for real time commands. The robot uses 12 MG90S servo motors (3 per leg) controlled by a PCA9685 PWM 16 channel controller with a Raspberry Pi Pico W running Rust firmware via EMbassy-rs. The robot will have a walking pattern with inverse kinematics, will be phone controlled with joystick movement, it will have some emote animations and body pose tilting via the MPU6050 gyroscope that I will also use for body orientation sensing and auto leveling.

## Motivation

I chose this project because I always was interested in the design and mechanical movement of robots, practically I wanted to combine mechanical design with embedded programming into this project. Building a walking robot would make me learn and understand inverse kinmatics, real time control and sensor fusion, all implemented in a Rust microcontroller, also the app should add a practical and fun user interface that makes the robot interactive.

## Architecture

![Arachne Architecture](./architecture_schematic.svg)

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Pico W**: Runs Embassy-rs async tasks for WiFi, gait engine, servo control, IMU reading
2. **I2C Peripherals**: PCA9685 servo driver, MPU6050 gyroscope, all on a shared I2C bus
3. **Flutter App**: TCP client with joystick, emote buttons and body pose control

## Log

### Week 5 - 8
I brainstormed ideas, chose my desired topic and got its approval. I ordered components. Verified Pico W blink and I2C channel.

### Week 9
Downloaded Fusion, learned how to use it and designed chassis and legs.

## Hardware

### Components

The system uses a Raspberry Pi Pico W (RP2040) as the main controller and for WiFi, a PCA9685 16-channel as a servo driver, 12 MG90S servos as leg joints, a MPU6050 (GY-521) gyroscope for body orientation sensing and a 7.4V 2S LiPo battery as power source.
