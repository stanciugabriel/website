## Description

This project is an interactive training station that uses a network of sensors to track physical hits and share the results over the internet. The system is built with several "interaction nodes" that connect to a main controller and a central dashboard.

The station works by using piezo sensors to measure exactly how hard and how fast a user hits a target. Because hitting these sensors can create high-voltage spikes, the system includes a protection circuit (Schottky-clamping). This keeps the sensitive electronics safe while ensuring the hit data is recorded accurately.

Users get instant feedback through three different channels:

    1. Visual: Bright RGB LED rings change colors to show the intensity of the hit.

    2. Audio: A buzzer plays different sounds for successful hits or errors.

    3. Data: A color screen displays live scores and menus, while a knob (potentiometer) lets the user manually adjust how sensitive the sensors are.

The "brain" of the system is the STM32U545RE-Q microcontroller. It runs on a modern software framework called Embassy-rs, which allows the code to handle many tasks at once without slowing down. Finally, an ESP32-C3 Wi-Fi module acts as a bridge, sending the performance data to an online dashboard so users can track their progress over time.

## Motivation

I have always been interested in how technology can be used to measure and improve human performance. Reaction time and physical precision are important in many areas, such as professional sports, physical therapy, and even industrial safety.

By building a system that gives instant feedback through lights and sounds, users can train their reflexes in a more engaging and effective way. Additionally, by adding Wi-Fi connectivity to the station, performance data can be tracked and saved over time. This allows users to stay aware of their progress, set personal goals, and find specific areas where they can improve their speed and accuracy.

## Architecture 

 Main Architectural Components:

1. Signal Acquisition Unit (Input)

    Role: Detects physical impacts and measures the force of each hit.

    Components: 3x Piezo Diaphragms and 1x Potentiometer (used for adjusting sensor sensitivity).

2. User Interface and Dashboard (I/O)

    Role: Manages the menu system and displays live scores and training data.

    Components: 1.8" SPI TFT Display and 3x Tactile Push Buttons (for navigation and selection).

3. Haptic Feedback System (Output)

    Role: Provides immediate visual and audio alerts to the user when a target is hit.

## Log


### Week 5:
- Research, decided on an idea
- Asked lab assistant about it, decided to improve it

### Week 6:
- Started to look at components 
- Decided on what I wanted to buy

### Week 7: 
- Waited for lab feedback
- Placed the order

### Week 8:
- Some components came, started to look into Ubuntu for this assignment
- Having problems with Windows/Linux environment but fixing them
- Received help with soldering some wires to my piezo sensors and RGB LED rings

### Week 11:
- Finished with KiCAD schematic
- Noticed 2 things when testing the protection circuit for the piezoel. sensors: I need a different capacitor ( 100nF instead of 200nF), missing FTF wires
- I also need a different potentiometer because the legs of the one I have right now are too short to reach into the breadboard, ordered it

### Week 12:
- Will start doing testing of hardware

## Hardware

The main component is the Nucleo STM32U545RE-Q board that acts as the central unit, analyzing real-time vibration data based on signals from three piezoelectric diaphragms taped underneath the training cups. To protect the microcontroller's ADC pins from high-voltage spikes caused by physical "thumps," each piezo is connected through a protection circuit using BAT41 Schottky diodes and high-value resistors. A potentiometer is integrated to provide a variable voltage signal, allowing the user to manually adjust the "Global Sensitivity" threshold for the training session.

For user feedback, the STM32 controls RGB LED rings to provide instant visual cues—turning green for a perfect hit, yellow for soft, and red for too hard—while a passive buzzer is tied to a PWM channel to generate audible warning tones. Detailed performance data, including reaction latency and impact force percentage, is transmitted via SPI to the display, which serves as a real-time scoreboard. Finally, the ESP32-C3 module handles Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, allowing the training data to be transmitted wirelessly for long-term progress tracking.
