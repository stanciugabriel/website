## Description

This automated vending machine system is built on a NUCLEO-U545RE-Q microcontroller and programmed in Rust. Allows users to browse and select different products through a digital interface that provides continuous communication and feedback throughout the process. To handle transactions, the machine supports two payment methods: coin insertion and card payment. In both cases, it verifies if the funds satisfy the specific price requirements of the selected item. Once the transaction conditions are met, the system automatically activates a dispensing mechanism to release the product to the user.

## Motivation

Vending machines are everywhere, yet few people think about the technology behind them. I was motivated by the challenge of simulating a real-world system from scratch, understanding every detail of how it works, from detecting a coin insertion to activating a motor to dispense a product.

## Hardware

- **NUCLEO-U545RE-Q Microcontroller:** The central processing unit of the system. 
- **4x4 Matrix Keypad:** A tactile interface that allows users to enter selections and confirm or cancel their transactions.
- **LCD 2004 Display (20x4):** The main output interface for the user used to communicate system states, instructions, and feedback messages.
- **I2C LCD Interface Module:** Used to minimize the required wiring to the microcontroller.
- **4x SG90 360-Degree Servo Motors:** Each servo motor controls a spiral dispensing 
mechanism assigned to a specific product slot. When a transaction is completed, the 
corresponding motor rotates to release the selected product.
- **2x IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensors:** Used to detect coin insertion. Each time a 
coin passes through the sensor, a signal is sent to the microcontroller to update 
the current balance.
- **RFID RC522 Module:** Acts as the card payment interface of 
the vending machine, simulating a real-world contactless payment terminal.
- **Power Supply Module:** A dedicated power regulation unit used to provide stable voltage and current to the servo motors, preventing electrical overload on the microcontroller.
- **Battery Holder:** Provides a portable power source for the system.
