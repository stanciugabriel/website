## Description

My breathalyzer device is an embedded project that meassures the amount of alcohol present in the users breath.

The output given by the breathalyzer is sent through an OLED display, a buzzer that recreates a police siren and an RGB LED that flashed blue and red, when alcohol is detected, everything physically connected through a breadboard. The program starts with an initial 2 minute "loading" time in which the MQ-3 alcohol sensor has to heat up.

## Motivation

When I was thinking of project ideas I wanted to make something related to music and I thought of a flute, in which you would blow into and based on the air preassure, a certain note would be played, then I remembered how you also blow into breathalyzers at police filters and I personally found this idea more unique, interesting and having more real world applications.

## Architecture

The project's architecture is thought of around the STM32 NUCLEO-U545RE-Q microcontroller. The workflow is:
* **Input:** The MQ-3 sensor constantly meassures the alcohol level in the air
* **Output:** The OLED Display, RGB LED and buzzers connected to the board give feedback to the user
* **Control:** The STM32 processes the input and based on its algorithm chooses what has to be done

How components connect:

## Log

### Week 5
* Researched required components and made a list
* Planned how everything will connect
* Ordered most of the components

### Week 6
* Tested the STM32 board
* Ordered the last component, the screen

### Week 7
* Researched about the MQ-3 sensor
* Started learning how to 3D model for the casing of the device

### Week 10
* 3D printed a box to build the project in
* Tested the display for the first time

## Hardware

The system is centered around the **STM32 NUCLEO-U545RE-Q** MCU. For output I am using an 1.3" OLED Display (SSD 1306 controller) using **I2C** for data transmission, a **passive buzzer** that gets a **PWM** signal, and an RGB LED that gets an oscilating **PWM** signal in the form of a 2D vector(since only red and blue are needed).

The OLED Display will have animations for the 2 minute waiting time and in the case of alcohol being detected.
