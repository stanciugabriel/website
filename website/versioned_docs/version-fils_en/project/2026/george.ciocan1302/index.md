## Description

RustRover is a Wi-Fi remote controlled vehicle trying to mimic the functionality of an 
exploration rover like the ones used on Mars. It collects samples, analyzes and stores 
them. Also, the onboard sensors get information about the environment. It uses a camera 
for ease of navigation and for identifying the samples by reading a QR code. A front loader 
arm picks the object and puts it in the cargo bay. Once powered on, a webpage is started where the rover can be controlled and a display shows the user the IP address where to connect to.

## Motivation

The motivation behind the project was my interests in aerospace and CAD modelling. A drone would've made more sense, but since I already had some of the components for building an RC car, I decided to make a Mars Rover. This way, I could make use of most of my parts, but also give it some personality through 3D printed parts and mechanisms designed by myself.

### Week 5 - 11 May

Got a first prototype working. The rover can be controlled with a smartphone, but no other peripherals are installed yet. For now, only the motor drivers and their motors are connected to the ESP32. Also, the power cables from the battery are connected to a master switch, after which they split in two power rails: 12V for the motors and a 5V from the buck converter for the ESP. The 6V converter will be connected later when adding the servos.

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

The main microcontroller, the ESP32 WROOM, creates its own Wi-Fi network to which the 
user connects with their phone. In browser, the user types the IP address shown on the display and a page with the camera view and rover controls appears. There are buttons to 
move the rover around and to rotate the camera. 
To pick up a sample, two conditions must be true at the same time: the ultrasonic sensor 
detects the sample in front of the rover and the camera scans the QR code on the sample 
to confirm its identity. If these are fulfilled, the loader arm descends, grabs the sample and 
throws it in the back of the rover, in the Weight/Analysis Station. Here, a pressure 
plate/weight sensor records the sample’s weight, saves it to a “database” and displays all 
the information about the sample on a display. After the sample is “analyzed”, a servo 
sweeps it in the cargo bay. And the cycle repeats. 
An additional temperature/humidity sensor on board might also provide information to be 
displayed/saved together with the sample measurements in the logs of the database.
