## Description

 Two identical hand-held consoles, each built around a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W with a 2.8" TFT screen, an analog joystick, and a buzzer. One console acts as its own Wi-Fi access point, the other joins it, and they exchange shots over a TCP socket. Players place their ships on a grid at the start, then take turns aiming the cursor with the joystick and firing, with sound effects and a live radar view on the display. The whole thing runs on bare-metal Rust with the embassy async framework — no operating system underneath.
 
## Motivation

 I would say my motivation mainly came from loving to play games, so when I looked through last year projects, I knew I had to do one myself. And after looking for a bit, I came to the conclusion that no one tried to do this classic game (hopefully for no reason in particular). So here I am now trying to make it happen.

## Log

### Week 4 idea thinking
I mainly tried to find a good idea for the project.
Researched past projects.
Saw games were pretty popular, and my idea came.

### Week 5 ordering parts
Tried to think what hardware do I need.
Placed the orders on the sites.

### Week 6 unboxing of the parts
All the stuff came and I mostly just made sure its all in good condition.
Ordered more stuff I realised i would need.

### Week 7 soldering and testing
Went to get the stuff soldered (pins on the Raspberrys).
Managed to get the screen to light up, and confirm all the pieces are working and usable for the project.

### Week 8 further testing
Started to research harder exact crates that I will need.
Attempted to make a functional display of a grid, important core functionality of the game.
Tested the joystick movement and interactions, to assure its able to move the target cursor accurately when it will be fully coded.

## Hardware

The project centres on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W as the microcontroller on each console — two identical hand-helds, one per player. A 2.8" ILI9341 SPI TFT display renders the game grid, radar sweep, and HUD. An analog joystick module with an integrated push-button provides all navigation and firing input via the onboard ADC and a GPIO. A passive piezo buzzer generates hit, miss and victory tones through a PWM output. The two consoles talk to each other over the Pico 2 W's onboard CYW43439 Wi-Fi chip — one console acts as a SoftAP, the other joins it, and gameplay is synchronised over a raw TCP socket. Each console is powered from a USB power bank for fully untethered play. Everything is wired on 400-point breadboards using male-male and male-female jumper wires, a 100 Ω series resistor in front of the buzzer, and 2.54 mm pin headers soldered onto the bare Pico boards.

Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W (Central Controller): runs the async Rust firmware (embassy-rp). Drives the SPI display, samples the joystick axes over the ADC, generates PWM tones on the buzzer pin, and owns the Wi-Fi radio + TCP socket that links it to the other console.

ILI9341 2.8" SPI TFT Display: shows the fleet-placement grid, radar view of enemy waters, HUD, and end-of-game stats.
Connection: SPI0 (SCK, MOSI) plus CS, DC and RESET on three GPIOs.

Analog Joystick Module: moves the cursor for ship placement and targeting; the built-in Z-axis push-button drops ships, fires shots, and confirms menu selections (long-press rotates ships during placement).
Connection: VRx and VRy into two ADC-capable GPIOs, SW into a pull-up GPIO.

Passive Piezo Buzzer: plays short jingles on every game event (fire click, miss thud, hit stab, sunk fanfare, victory/defeat songs).
Connection: PWM output on one GPIO through a 100 Ω series resistor to the buzzer's positive pin.

Onboard CYW43439 Wi-Fi Chip: hosts or joins a private SoftAP and carries the game protocol between the two consoles.
Connection: internal to the Pico 2 W, driven over the PIO-SPI bus on four dedicated pins — no external wiring.

USB Power Bank (per console): supplies 5 V into the Pico's VBUS via the USB-C port, powering the MCU, the display (on 5 V), and the 3V3 rail feeding the joystick.
