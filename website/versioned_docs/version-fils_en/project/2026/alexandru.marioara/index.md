## Description
This project implements a standalone, fully functional digital music player. It reads audio files from a MicroSD card and outputs sound using the microcontroller's internal DAC (Digital-to-Analog Converter) combined with an external PAM8403 analog amplifier. The system features a graphical interface on an OLED display and allows hardware control via a rotary encoder, IR remote, and tactile buttons.

## Motivation
Music is an essential part of my daily life, and listening to it is a habit I enjoy every single day. This inspired me to build a digital music player from scratch, turning an everyday activity into a complex engineering challenge. From a technical standpoint, this project allows me to combine multiple communication protocols (SPI, I2C) and core microcontroller peripherals (Timers, DMA, DAC) into a single, cohesive product. Instead of using off-the-shelf "smart" modules that do the decoding automatically, I want the STM32 to handle the raw data stream and precisely output it through the internal DAC. This forces me to step out of my comfort zone and tackle real-time asynchronous data streaming using Rust's `embassy` framework.

## Architecture

The system architecture is centralized around the STM32 microcontroller which handles data fetching, UI updates, and audio signal generation.

```

The system architecture revolves around the STM32U545RE microcontroller:
1. **Input:** Data is read asynchronously from the MicroSD card via SPI. User input is captured via a Rotary Encoder, an IR sensor (for remote control), and tactile buttons.
2. **Processing:** The STM32 parses the WAV file format and feeds the raw PCM audio data into memory buffers.
3. **Output:** The data is pushed via DMA to the internal DAC to generate an analog audio signal. This signal is then boosted by a PAM8403 amplifier to drive the speaker. The UI state (current song, volume) is updated on the I2C OLED display.
