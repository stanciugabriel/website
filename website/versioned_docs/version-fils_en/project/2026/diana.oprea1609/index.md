## Description

This project aims to develop a system that allows real-time control of a Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS) setup using a PS4 controller.
The system reads controller input on a PC, processes it, and sends commands via Bluetooth to an STM32 microcontroller, which generates control signals for an analog circuit. This circuit produces a low, controlled current applied through two symmetrically driven electrodes to influence the user’s perception of movement and balance.
In addition, the system integrates a heart rate sensor and an LCD display that shows the measured pulse in real time. This allows monitoring of the user’s physiological response during stimulation, making it possible to observe whether changes in balance or perceived movement lead to increased heart rate, which can indicate stress or nervousness.

## Motivation

I chose this project because I am very interested in how technology can interact with human perception, especially in systems that directly influence the way we experience movement and balance.
The idea started when I saw an online video of someone actually experiencing Galvanic Vestibular Stimulation (GVS), where electrical stimulation was used to create the sensation of movement or tilt. Seeing a real person react to it made the concept much more tangible and interesting, so I started researching it in more detail.
While exploring the topic, I discovered that GVS is used not only in immersive technologies, but also in research and biomedical applications, such as studying the vestibular system, balance control, and human perception. This made the project more interesting to me, as it is not just a technical system, but something that directly interacts with the human body.
At the same time, I am also interested in biomedical devices and how electrical signals can be used safely to influence or measure physiological processes. This project combines these aspects, as it involves generating controlled electrical stimulation that affects perception, while requiring careful design to ensure safety.
Overall, this project allows me to explore the intersection between embedded systems, analog electronics, and biomedical engineering, while working with a concept that has both experimental and real-world applications.
