## Description

This project is a custom-built, wireless split mechanical keyboard based on the ergonomic Corne physical layout. To maximize hardware complexity and avoid prebuilt kits, the keyboard uses no PCB; instead, the switch matrix is entirely handwired. The core of the project is writing a custom embedded Rust firmware from scratch using the embassy-rs framework to handle matrix scanning, key debouncing, and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication.

## Motivation

I chose this project to gain deep, hands-on experience with both bare-metal electronics and modern embedded software. On the hardware side, handwiring the diode matrix forces a complete understanding of how electrical grids operate. On the software side, writing the firmware in Rust provides the opportunity to learn embassy-rs for asynchronous embedded programming and to understand how to implement a BLE HID (Human Interface Device) stack from the ground up. Also I want to some watch movies in the summer on my tv and I need a keyboard to type on the internet so that the search is way faster.

## Architecture 

- The system architecture consists of a custom electrical matrix and an asynchronous Rust software stack.

- The Hardware Matrix: 42 mechanical switches are handwired into a matrix of Rows and Columns. Diodes are soldered to each switch to prevent electrical "ghosting" when multiple keys are pressed.

- The Microcontroller: An NRF52840 development board acts as the central brain, connected to the matrix rows and columns via its GPIO pins. It is powered by a 3.7V LiPo battery.

- The Rust Firmware: The software utilizes embassy-rs for async execution. A polling task continuously scans the GPIO matrix to detect state changes.

- Bluetooth Communication: Using the nrf-softdevice crate, the microcontroller advertises itself as a BLE Keyboard and transmits the processed keystroke data over the air to a host computer.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May

Finalized component research and ordered all necessary hardware (microcontrollers, switches, batteries, keycaps) -> Waiting for their delievery.

### Week 12 - 18 May

So far, I've 3D printed the baseplate for the switches to snap into. I went with a hand-wired matrix setup, including diodes for reliable input. I've also soldered a power switch and a battery, which I tested with a multimeter. I connected the columns and one of the rows to the microcontroller just to check the continuity. This is all for the first half of the build; I plan to wrap up the other half later this week.

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

The hardware relies on a 3D-printed chassis to hold the switches, eliminating the need for a PCB. The logic is handled by NRF52840 chips due to their low power consumption and excellent Bluetooth capabilities.
