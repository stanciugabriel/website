## Description

This project is an advanced, multi-layered active security and environmental monitoring hub built on the STM32. The core feature is a 2D scanning system using a VL53L0X Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor mounted on a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor, which streams Cartesian coordinate data to a laptop via USB Bulk transfers to render a real-time radar map. Additional sensors provide intrusion detection and environmental telemetry.

## Motivation

I chose this project because it combines precise motor control, real-time data acquisition from a vast array of sensors, and PC-device USB communication into a single robust system. It is a highly practical and technically challenging way to explore asynchronous embedded programming in Rust.

## Architecture

![System Architecture Diagram](./schematic.svg)

Main software and system components:
- **Scanning Module**: reads distance from VL53L0X via I2C and steps motor via GPIO.
- **Intrusion Detection Module**: reads Doppler radar, vibration, and sound sensors.
- **Access Control Module**: handles the 4x4 matrix keypad and IR receiver.
- **Environmental Module**: reads BMP180 (I2C) and photoresistors (ADC).
- **Local Feedback Module**: controls the 4-digit display, buzzer (PWM), and LEDs.
- **Communication Module**: sends serialized coordinate payloads via USB Bulk to the PC.

## Log

### Week 4
- Established the project idea and worked on the component list.

### Week 5-6
- Ordered all hardware components (STM32, VL53L0X, stepper motor, etc.).
- Researched the Embassy framework and USB Bulk transfer implementation in Rust.

### Week 7
- Components arrived, started testing and tinkering with them.

### Week 8-9 
- Hardware Integration. Began assembling the core scanning module by mounting the VL53L0X ToF sensor to the 28BYJ-48 stepper motor shaft.
- Circuit Prototyping. Mapped out the pin connections on the 830-point breadboard for the I2C bus (sensor), GPIO sequence (ULN2003 driver), and the security sensor array.
- Software Design. Drafted the Embassy task architecture, defining the synchronization channels between the scanning task and the USB communication task.


## Hardware

The system uses an STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q as the central hub. It orchestrates a VL53L0X ToF sensor mounted on a 5V stepper motor for spatial scanning, alongside a suite of security sensors (Doppler radar, vibration, sound, keypad) and environmental sensors (BMP180, photoresistors). Everything is wired on a universal 830-point breadboard.
