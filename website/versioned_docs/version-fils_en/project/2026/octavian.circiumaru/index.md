## Description

Reaction Time is an embedded system game that measures how fast a user reacts to a signal. The system waits for a random delay, then prompts the user with visual and auditory signals, measuring the time taken to respond.

## Motivation

I chose this project to explore how human reaction time works and how it can be accurately measured using an embedded system. Reaction time is an important indicator in many real-world scenarios, from gaming and sports to driving and safety-critical systems. By implementing this project, we can better understand how delays, stimuli, and user responses interact in real time.

## Architecture 

The system is composed of several logical components:

- **Input Handler**: manages push button inputs (start, reaction, reset)
- **Game Logic Controller**: handles game states (idle, waiting, signal, result, false start)
- **Timing Module**: measures reaction time using hardware timers
- **Display Module**: outputs instructions and results to the LCD
- **Signal Module**: controls LED and buzzer for user prompt
- **Random Delay Generator**: creates unpredictable wait times before signal

## Log

### Week 4 

- Thought about project ideas and researched about required hardware components.

### Week 6

- Received project feedback and the components arrived.

### Week 7

- Started testing the components.
- Built an initial circuit to connect the STM to the LCD screen.

### Week 9

- Work on documentation and software part of the project.

## Hardware

The system is built around the STM NUCLEO-U545RE-Q microcontroller, which manages inputs, timing, and outputs. The user interacts with the system using three push buttons connected to GPIO pins, while feedback is provided through a 20x4 I2C LCD display, a LED (with current-limiting resistor), and a buzzer. All components are connected on a breadboard using jumper wires (M-M, M-F), with additional resistors for stability and decoupling capacitors for reliable operation. Communication is handled via GPIO and I2C, and the system is powered and programmed through the USB (ST-Link) interface.
