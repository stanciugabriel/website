## Description

The Listenus project aims to be a standalone device that recognizes songs playing in the background and displays the song details(like author, name)on a local OLED screen. The system operates independently, requiring no smartphone application, providing a seamless listening experience. Listenus recognizes songs playing in the background on demand. Unlike a continuous listener, the device remains in a low-power idle state until the user triggers a capture session via a physical button or command.

## Motivation

I chose this project after seeing a video on Tiktok explaining the math behind Shazam's recognition system, specifically how it uses FFT to break down audio frequencies and create unique acoustic fingerprints. I was completely fascinated by how a physical sound wave could be mathematically mapped and matched against a massive database almost instantly. That curiosity made me want to explore the concept myself. It also solves a very real, everyday frustration: hearing an incredible song and missing it because you couldn't pull your phone out and open an app in time. So, I wanted a one-button solution that is always ready to listen. 
On the technical side, this project is my excuse to dive into Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and embedded audio. It forces me to step far out of my comfort zone and tackle real challenges like I2S digital audio streaming, DMA memory management, and writing asynchronous Rust firmware to connect raw hardware to modern cloud APIs.

## Architecture

The logic is designed to be a smooth, "on-demand" process that balances speed with power efficiency. It all starts in a low-power idle state, where the **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** is essentially "napping" while waiting for a signal from the push button. Once you press it, the system jumps into action and opens a precise recording window: the **INMP441** microphone streams digital audio over the **I2S** path, while a background helper called **DMA** handles moving that data into memory. This is crucial because it prevents the processor from "stuttering", ensuring the audio is captured perfectly without any glitches.
After the recording is done, the Pico uses its integrated **Wi-Fi** to send the audio data to the **Audd.io API** through a secure web request. As soon as the service identifies the song and sends back the details (in a **JSON** format), the Pico reads the info and immediately shows the artist and song title on the **SSD1306 OLED** screen via the **I2C** connection. Everything is managed by the **Embassy** async executor, which acts like a multitasker that keeps the device responsive. Once the song is identified and displayed, the system automatically goes back to sleep, waiting for the next time you hear a song you want to catch.

## Log

### Week 1-3
- Developed the initial concept for Listenus: a portable, independent song identification device.    
- Researched audio fingerprinting algorithms and public APIs for music recognition (e.g., AudD, ACRCloud).    
- Analyzed hardware requirements for digital audio capture (I2S protocol) and low-power Wi-Fi connectivity.


### Week 4-6
- ordered the Starter Electronics Kit    
- ordered the INMP441 microphone and the SSD1306 OLED screen.    
- ordered STM32 for the initisal plan of the project

### Week 7
- talked with the laboratory assistant to discuss project arhitecture   
- based on the requirements for integrated Wi-Fi and better support for the Embassy (Rust) framework, I decided with the lab assitant to change the arhitecture from stm32 to raspberry pi pico2w    
- ordered raspberry pi pico 2w   
- soldered some components for the project with assistant help   
- did reasearch on how to make the project independent from the pc using battery

### Week 8-9
- verified the INMP441 microphone is working.   
- successfully initialized the SSD1306 display using the `ssd1306` crate.   
- started working on the harware

### Week 10-13
- decided to integrate a battery holder into the hardware design to make the system fully portable for ambient music recognition
- analyzed the power consumption of the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W and the microphone to ensure the selected battery can sustain long term operation
-did the KiCad schematic to include the battery holder and the necessary power routing for independent operation
-shifted the project focus towards a standalone device approach, eliminating the need for a constant USB power supply
