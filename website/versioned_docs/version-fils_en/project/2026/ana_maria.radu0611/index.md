## Description

“Catch the falling apples” is a classic arcade game controlled by the STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q. The game is displayed on a 1.8-inch screen, where apples fall from the top of the screen and the user has to catch them using a basket. The movement of basket is controlled with a biaxial joystick.

## Motivation

Ever since I was a kid, I’ve been passionate about playing games in my free time. When I started learning how to code, I wanted to start making my own game. However, building a modern and complex game requires a lot of time, resources and knowledge. So for this project, I decided to recreate a classic game from my childhood, with the help of hardware components, not only digitally.

## Architecture

This project's architecture revolves around the STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q microcontroller.

- **STM32 Nucleo-U545RE-Q**
- **Breadboard**: allows easy connections among the components of the project
- **LCD SPI 128x160 Module**: the screen where the game will be displayed.
- **Joystick breakout board**: the joystick which will be used to move the basket to the left or to the right.
- **3 Blue LEDs**: the LEDs which will show the remaining lives of the player. They are all turned on when the game starts and one of them turns off when an apple falls on the ground.
- **1 RGB LED**: this LED will turn green when the player catches and apple, red when an apple falls on the ground and when the player loses the game, and yellow for a 3-seconds countdown before the game starts.
- **2 Passive Buzzers**: one of these buzzers will make a sound each time the player loses one life. The other buzzer will make different sounds when the game starts and when it ends.

## Log

### Week 30 March - 5 April
I sent my project idea and received feedback.

### Week 6 - 12 April
I ordered the components based on the feedback and picked them up.

### Week 13 - 19 April
I did some initial testing to see if the components work.

### Week 20 - 26 April
I continued the testing, wrote the page of the website and started writing the actual code of the project.

### Week 27 April - 3 May
I had an issue where my screen would stay white, regardless of the commands written in code. I managed to fix it by using a different crate. Also, I found a way of drawing my objects by importing images modified on a website which created an array of pixels. I had to find a way to remove the white background of the pictures, which turned out to be different shades of white, so I couldn't just manually exclude those pixels.

### Week 4 - 10 May
I had a problem where the buzzers were not working, but I fixed it. I finished the wiring, which will be slightly changed later on, and I finished the KiCAD schematic.
