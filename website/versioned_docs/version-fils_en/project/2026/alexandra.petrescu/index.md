## Description

My project idea was to try and implement a smart security system logic on a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W, with the help of a PIR sensor for motion detection, an IR sensor, and a buzzer for audio alarms. The entire logic will be written
in rust using the Embassy framework to ensure asynchronous execution

## Motivation

The main reason why I chose to build this project was because I wanted it to be very interactive, and this idea gave me the perfect way to do it. Besides the coding aspect of it, I wanted to do something that would actually
challenge me in terms of hardware and that would ultimately provide immediate and physical feedback, such as waving my hand in front of a sensor and the system actually reacting. Furthermore, I definitely wanted to work
with a Raspberry Pi Pico and see for myself the way it performs and can handle a real-world problem.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 11 May
This week I was able to work on most of my hardware, successfully managing to test all of the components and visualize the final outline of the project. I also finally managed to connect the Pico 2W to my code, as I had struggled for a few days to get it to flash. Half of the software is done, and so far nothing has gone wrong, except for the fact that I am thinking about replacing some hardware components, such as my keypad and LED ring.

### Week 12 - 18 May

## Hardware

![Hardware Picture](./imghardware.webp)

1. Raspberry Pi Pico 2W: The main microcontroller unit running the asynchronous rust firmware;
2. PIR Motion Sensor: Used to detect human movement in the monitored area;
3. IR Proximity Snesor: Acts as a secondary close-range trigger, detecting any objects passing directly in front of it;
4. Active Buzzer: Provides the loud audible alarm when a security breach is detected;
5. Push Button: Allows the user to physically arm or disarm the system;
6. Status LED (with a 330OHM resistor): Gives visual feedback on the current state of the alarm(Armed, Disarmed, Triggered);
7. Breadboard & Jumper Wires: It will be used for prototyping and connecting all peripherals to the Pico's GPIO pins.
