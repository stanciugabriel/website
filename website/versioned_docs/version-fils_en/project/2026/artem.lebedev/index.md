## Description

This project is a coffee vending machine capable of creating a variety of coffee drinks using a gravity- and time-based dispenser of hot water and instant coffee. To implement this idea, we'll use a solenoid valve for the water tank, a servo motor with a flap for the coffee container, drink selection buttons, and a host of additional features: an LCD screen displaying the brewing process and water level, a buzzer to notify when the coffee is ready, and a float sensor to indicate when the water level is low. At the core of all these devices will be an ESP32-C6 chip; the enclosure will be a wooden T-shaped structure.

## Motivation

My desire to build a coffee machine, rather than any other device, is easy to explain – I'm a big fan of this aromatic drink, and if I'm going to do anything, it's going to be something I personally wouldn't shy away from using. Of course, my design is a far cry from a professional coffee machine, but at the same time, I think it will provide worthy competition to the machines dotted around campus.

## Architecture

The system is organized into three functional layers:

**Input Layer**
- Three tactile push buttons select the drink mode: Espresso, Double Espresso, or Americano.
- A float switch liquid level sensor monitors the water tank and signals when it is empty.

**Control Layer**
- The ESP32-C6 SuperMini runs the main async task loop via Embassy.
- On button press, a mode-specific timing profile is selected, and serving coffee and water for the correct duration starts.
- The water sensor is polled continuously; if the tank is empty, dispensing is blocked and the display shows a warning.

**Output Layer**
- A 12V solenoid valve (normally closed) controls water flow from the tank to the cup, driven by an IRF540N MOSFET with a 100Ω gate resistor.
- A servo motor (SG90) opens and closes a mechanical gate on the coffee powder container.
- An SSD1306 OLED display (0.96", I2C) shows brewing status and warnings.

All components share a common ground. The 12V rail powers the solenoid valve and is supplied by an external 12V 2A DC adapter. The ESP32-C6 is powered via USB.

## Log

### Week 5 - 11 May 

Awaiting arrival of remaining components, added minor changes in the hardware by replacing 100 Ohm resistor for 1K and 10K ones and IRF540N transistor for IRF3205PBF as well as GPIO's of some devices; also the power supply of solenoid been changed to direct supply from adaptor.

## Hardware

The system is built around the ESP32-C6 SuperMini microcontroller, which manages all inputs and outputs over GPIO, PWM (LEDC), and I2C. Two food-grade plastic containers (1–2L) serve as the water and coffee powder tanks, each mounted above the dispensing point to allow gravity-fed flow.

Water flow is controlled by a 12V normally-closed solenoid valve. When the ESP32-C6 pulls the MOSFET gate high, the valve opens and hot water flows through a silicone tube into the cup. The MOSFET (IRF540N) is connected with a 100Ω resistor on the gate to limit switching transients.

Coffee powder is dispensed through a mechanical gate controlled by the SG90 servo. At rest, the gate is closed. When activated, the servo rotates 90° to open the gate, powder falls by gravity, and the servo returns to close it after the timed duration.
