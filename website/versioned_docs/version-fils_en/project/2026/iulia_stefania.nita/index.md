## Description

This project focuses on building an automated fish feeding and environmental monitoring system using the Rust programming language for high reliability. The system uses an STM32 microcontroller for precise hardware control and an ESP8266 module for Wi-Fi connectivity. It is designed to dispense food at scheduled intervals using a servo motor while simultaneously monitoring water temperature and water level to ensure a safe environment for the fish. The device displays live sensor data on a small TFT screen and allows the user to trigger an instant feeding remotely from their phone, offering a simple and hands-free way to care for aquatic life.

## Motivation
The motivation is my desire to create a more sustainable way to manage home ecosystems. Traditional fish care often involves low-quality electronics that eventually end up in a landfill, and inconsistent feeding habits that negatively affect water quality. By using a regulated battery power supply and high-durability components, I am building a device designed for longevity. Furthermore, by using a real-time clock to enforce precise feeding schedules and sensors to continuously monitor water temperature and level, I am reducing the risk of overfeeding and organic waste buildup in the water. This helps maintain a cleaner tank environment and reduces the frequency of water changes, ultimately saving water and resources. Beyond the environmental aspect, this project also represents a personal challenge to work with embedded systems and the Rust programming language.

## Architecture 

The microcontroller unit, built around the STM32 NUCLEO-U545RE-Q, serves as the central brain of the device. It runs all firmware logic using asynchronous embedded Rust via the Embassy framework, coordinating every peripheral and task concurrently without a traditional operating system. It processes sensor readings, updates the display, enforces feeding schedules, and handles incoming remote commands.

The sensing subsystem consists of the DS18B20 waterproof temperature sensor, the water level sensor, and the infrared obstacle sensor. These components continuously provide the microcontroller with real-time data about the aquarium environment and the state of the food hopper. The DS3231 RTC module complements this subsystem by maintaining precise time tracking, ensuring that scheduled feedings remain accurate even after a power cut or battery swap.

The communication module is built around the ESP8266 ESP-01 Wi-Fi module, which connects the device to the home network and enables remote control from the user's phone. Commands are received over the network and passed to the STM32 through a UART serial connection, allowing the user to trigger an immediate feeding from anywhere within Wi-Fi range.

The actuation system is centered on the SG90 micro servo motor, which physically controls the food hopper gate to dispense portions of fish food. The STM32 drives the servo using a PWM signal, while a dedicated power line with a 1000µF capacitor ensures the motor receives stable current without causing voltage drops that could affect the rest of the circuit.

The power management system supplies the entire device from a 4×AA battery pack, stepped down to a stable 3.3V through a voltage regulator for all logic components. Bypass capacitors on each major component filter noise on the power rail, and a CR2032 coin cell on the DS3231 module keeps the real-time clock running independently whenever the main power supply is disconnected.

## Hardware

 The primary processing unit responsible for executing the hardware is built around the STM32 NUCLEO-U545RE-Q as the central processing unit, interfacing with all peripherals through its GPIO, SPI, I2C, UART, and PWM pins. The sensing subsystem includes the DS18B20 temperature sensor on a 1-Wire bus, the DS3231 RTC over I2C backed by a CR2032 coin cell, and the infrared and water level sensors on direct GPIO inputs. The ESP8266 ESP-01 module connects to the STM32 over UART for Wi-Fi communication, while the ST7735 TFT display is driven over SPI. The SG90 servo motor is controlled via PWM and powered directly from the battery rail, with a 1000µF capacitor stabilizing its power line during actuation. The entire system is supplied by a 4×AA battery pack stepped down to 3.3V through a voltage regulator, with bypass capacitors on each major component ensuring a clean and stable power rail.
