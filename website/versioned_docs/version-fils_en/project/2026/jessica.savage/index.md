## Description

This project is a CD storage and retrieval system that is build on a stand where CDs are arranged on a rotating platform. In the center of the structure there is a stepper motor that rotates the entire stand.
The system can be controlled by a joystick and a display or remotely via Bluetooth from a phone. Once a CD is selected, the stepper motor rotates the stand until the chosen CD reaches the front position. At this point, a servo motor is activated and pushes the CD outward for an easier access. 

## Motivation

I chose this project idea beacause i wanted to make something that accesses a CD collection easier and faster. Instead of manually searching through a stack of CDs, you cand simply browse for a desired album and the system will locate and present it.

## Architecture

The whole system is built around an STM32 microcontroller. It receives commands either from the joystick-based local interface or through the Bluetooth module connected to a phone.

## Log

### Week 6

I came with the project idea and received a feedback.

### Weeks 7-8

 According to the feedback i tried to improve my project and I ordered the components.

### Week 9

I received the components and started testing them to see if everything works.
