## Description

IronBeats is a 3-lane rhythm game (inspired by Piano Tiles and Guitar Hero) developed for the STM32F767ZI microcontroller. The game utilizes a 4-in-1 MAX7219 LED Matrix (8x32) as the primary game board where "notes" fall vertically. Players must interact with three physical buttons to catch notes within a strict timing window. A secondary 1.3" OLED displays the menu system, real-time score, and persistent leaderboard saved in the internal Flash memory. The project emphasizes deterministic latency and real-time concurrency using the Rust Embassy framework.

## Motivation

The choice of this project stems from a desire to explore Real-Time Systems and Hardware-Software Co-design. Developing a rhythm game requires solving critical engineering problems:

2. Deterministic Latency: Ensuring that button interrupts are processed with sub-millisecond precision.

1. Resource Management: Efficiently sharing a single SPI bus between two distinct display technologies (OLED and LED Matrix).

3. Rust in Embedded: Leveraging Rust's ownership model and the Embassy async executor to manage multiple concurrent tasks (audio, visuals, and logic) without a traditional Operating System.

## Architecture 
The system is centralized around the STM32F767ZI (Cortex-M7) which handles the high-speed game loop, user input debouncing, and peripheral data streaming.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 1 - 7
Brainstormed the idea and consulted my professors regarding the project idea.
Hardware acquisition finalized (STM32, MAX7219, SH1106 OLED).

### Weeks 7-9
Developed the project logic and power scheme as well as implemented basic GPIO blinky and serial logging for debuggin every component involved in the project.

### Weeks 8-10
Finished the full hardware schematic in KiCad, including pin mapping for SPI peripherals and the joystick's voltage dividers. Resolved all Electrical Rules Check (ERC) conflicts and finalized the wiring for the buttons, buzzers, and displays.

### Weeks 10-12
Integrated the hardware and architecture diagrams into the GitHub documentation and set up the project's README. Started the Rust implementation for button inputs, focusing on the 200ms software lockout logic to ensure accurate gameplay detection.
### Weeks 12-14

## Hardware

IronBeats is a bare-metal Rust rhythm game powered by an STM32F767ZI microcontroller, ensuring precise gameplay timing. An 8x32 LED matrix serves as the vertical runway for falling notes, while a 1.3" OLED handles menus and leaderboards. Three tactile buttons let players catch notes in specific lanes, with three passive buzzers providing real-time audio feedback. A joystick controls UI navigation, and a 5V power bank safely drives the entire hardware system
