## Description

A smart, automated pet feeder that reliably dispenses perfectly portioned meals on schedule while keeping track of your cat's daily eating routines. It actively monitors for food jams to ensure your pet is always fed, and automatically logs exactly when they visit the bowl so you can easily monitor their habits.

## Motivation

The primary motivation for this project is the daily challenge of managing the demanding feeding schedules of my two hungry cats. Manually dispensing exact portions multiple times a day is difficult and inconsistent, especially during early mornings or when I am not at home

## Architecture

```
Main software and system components:\
-Core Controller: The Rust-based central brain that manages the state machine, evaluates feeding schedules, and processes sensor data.\
-Perception Subsystem: Handles all real-time inputs, including offline timekeeping (RTC), exact weight monitoring (ADC), cat presence detection (PIR), and manual button presses.\
-Actuation & UI Subsystem: Executes commands by driving the physical food-dispensing servo motor and provides real-time feedback via the color screen, LEDs, and buzzer.\
-Data Persistence: Manages non-volatile storage, automatically logging feeding success events and cat visitation timestamps directly to the MicroSD card.\
-Feedback Loops: The internal logic that connects inputs to outputs-automatically stopping the motor when the target weight is reached or reversing it if a food jam is detected.\
