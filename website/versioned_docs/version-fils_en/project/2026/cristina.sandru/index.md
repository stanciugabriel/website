## Description
This project is an interactive installation consisting of three mechanical flowers. The project uses a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W and the Rust Embassy framework to create a non-blocking, async system. The flowers react to user input via BLE (mood selection) and environmental light levels.

## Motivation
I chose this project to explore a multi-core embedded environment. I want to see how a microcontroller can handle complex animations, wireless communication, and sensor fusion simultaneously, all while creating something aesthetically pleasing.

## Architecture
It follows a multi-tasking approach, splitting responsibilities between the MCU's two hardware cores to ensure smooth animation and responsive networking.

* **User Interface (Mobile App):** A BLE client running on a smartphone that sends mood selection commands to the hardware.
* **Connectivity Task (Core 0):** An asynchronous task handling the BLE stack, reading received mood packets, and interfacing with the external AI API over WiFi to fetch specific animation parameters (like Bezier curve control points).
* **Sensor Task (Core 0):** Monitors the LDR light sensor through the ADC. It implements hysteresis logic to detect environmental state changes.
* **Main Logic Control (Core 0):** It parses JSON parameters from the API, manages the flower state machines (Opening, Closing, Resting, Breathing), and pushes direct movement commands into an inter-core FIFO queue.
* **Actuator Control Task (Core 1):** Dedicated task for real-time operations. It reads command buffers from the FIFO and drives the Servo Motors via PWM and the WS2812B LEDs via PIO, using Bezier interpolation for organic motion.

## Log
* **Week 1 - 4:** Initial research. I spent time looking for the right hardware to balance the weight of the petals with the SG90 servos. I also started reading about some concepts and the async syntax in Rust.
* **Week 5 -7 May:** Ordered the main components, soldered the pins for the Pico 2W.
* **Week  8:** I started working on the petals, using cooper wire and cooper tubes for the movements, soldering the petals to the tubes.

- **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W**
- **3xSG90 micro servos** 
- **WS2812B LED strip**
