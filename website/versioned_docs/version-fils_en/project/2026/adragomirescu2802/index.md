## Description

The Smart Parking System monitors parking spots in real time using ultrasonic sensors. A servo motor controls a barrier that opens automatically when there are open spots in the parking lot, or when a valid PIN is entered via a keypad in the case of a reserved spot. A display shows the current status of the parking lot and prompts you to enter the reservation code via a keypad, and a web interface hosted on the Raspberry Pi Pico W allows users to reserve spots remotely over WiFi.

## Motivation

I chose this project because it combines multiple hardware components and communication protocols into a single practical system. It covers areas like sensor reading, motor control, display output, network communication, and user input — making it a comprehensive project that reflects everything learned throughout the semester.

## Architecture

![Architecture Diagram](architecture.svg)

The system is built around the Raspberry Pi Pico W as the central controller, running software written in Rust using the embassy-rp async framework.

Main components:

* **Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W** — main microcontroller, handles all logic and WiFi
* **Ultrasonic Sensors (HC-SR04 x6)** — detect whether each parking spot is occupied
* **Servo Motor (SG90)** — controls the entry/exit barrier
* **ST7735 TFT Display (1.8" 128x160)** — shows parking spot availability and system status
* **3x4 Keypad** — allows users to enter a PIN to open the barrier
* **Status LEDs (x6)** — one per spot, give instant visual feedback on occupancy
* **Web Interface** — hosted on the Pico 2 W, accessible over WiFi for remote reservation

All components communicate with the Pico 2 W directly: ultrasonic sensors via GPIO, servo via PWM, TFT display via SPI, keypad via GPIO matrix scanning, LEDs via GPIO, and the web interface via the onboard WiFi stack.

## Log

### Week 4-5

After going through multiple possible projects, finally landed on the basic idea of a smart parking system and started researching exactly what hardware components would be needed.

### Week 5-6

Expanded on the original idea by adding the web interface for online reservations.

### Week 7-8

Ordered all necessary components, currently waiting on their delivery.

## Hardware

The hardware is based on the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 W microcontroller. Six HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors detect the presence of a vehicle in each parking spot. An SG90 servo motor acts as a barrier gate. An ST7735 1.8" TFT display shows real-time status over SPI. A 3x4 matrix keypad is used for PIN input, and six status LEDs provide instant visual feedback on spot occupancy.
