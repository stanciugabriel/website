## Description

The **WIFI Commander** is a fully portable, *smart* magic wand designed to manage networks using *"magic"* spells. Upon cast, the spell, also referred as **command** is then sent to the target OpenWRT device, and the result is displayed on the screen. It translates physical hand gestures into network administration tasks.


## Motivation

My drive to help people made me learn a lot about OpenWRT routers in order to build custom images for the people living in the dorms. Creating such a tool will help me, saving time diagnosing and maintaining them, providing a "God Mode" physical remote for network administration.

## Architecture 

The project is built around a distributed micro-architecture consisting of two main physical "devices" communicating wirelessly:

1. The WIFI Wand (Transmitter & Sensor Node)
2. The WIFI Controller (Base Station & Router Interface)

## Log

### Week 8
* **Research & Architecture Phase:** Completed research on the hardware and software architecture.
* Investigated Digital Signal Processing (DSP) and complementary filters for the MPU6050 sensor to accurately recognize hand gestures and filter out tremors.
* Selected the **ESP-NOW** protocol for ultra-low latency wireless communication between the Wand and the Base Controller.
* Explored the OpenWRT `ubus` HTTP API for executing remote network administration commands without relying on SSH.

### Week 9
* **Hardware Procurement:** Finalized the complete Bill of Materials (BOM).
* Officially placed orders for all necessary hardware components (ESP32-S3 SuperMini, ESP8266 NodeMCU, MPU6050, TP4056 modules, Li-Po battery, jumper wires, etc.) from suppliers.
* Currently awaiting delivery of the components to begin breadboard testing and initial hardware assembly.

### Week 10
* Components have arrived and have started breadboard testing with some success.
* Started writing software for the WIFI Wand, struggling with the MPU6050 and clean data from it.

### Week 11 
* Finalized hardware wiring and testing on a breadboard. Will need to start finishing the software side.

### Week 12 *(Current Week)*
*(To be filled during development)*

### Week 13
*(To be filled during development)*

### Week 14
*(To be filled during development)*
## Hardware

The hardware is split into a low-power, lightweight handheld device (the Wand) powered by a small Li-Po battery, and a stationary base unit (the Controller) that processes and routes the commands.
