## Description



The goal of this project is to build an interactive, physical desktop dashboard that monitors PC hardware telemetry in real-time. Instead of relying on traditional on-screen software overlays, this device brings the data to the physical world using a custom 3D-printed enclosure, analog gauges, and a digital display.



The system communicates with the host PC via two simultaneous channels: a wireless Bluetooth connection (HC-05 via UART) for receiving telemetry data, and a wired USB connection configured as a Human Interface Device (HID).



On the front panel, two SG90 servo motors act as analog needles constantly displaying the CPU and GPU temperatures. Between them, an SSD1306 OLED screen provides detailed digital readouts. By rotating the KY-040 encoder, the user can switch the OLED menu to view CPU/GPU load percentages or Network speeds.



The dashboard also features an active hardware alarm with multi-sensory feedback. If the CPU or GPU temperature exceeds a hardcoded threshold (e.g., 85°C), the STM32 triggers a piezo buzzer, activates a coin vibration motor, and shifts the WS2812B RGB LED lighting to a flashing red state. Additionally, pressing the encoder button utilizes the USB HID connection to send multimedia keyboard commands (like Mute or Volume Up/Down) directly to the PC.



## Motivation



I chose this project because I wanted to build something I would actually use every day on my desk, rather than just a laboratory prototype. Monitoring thermals is important for PC performance, but software overlays can be annoying and take up valuable screen space while working or gaming. A dedicated physical dashboard solves this problem elegantly.



From a technical perspective, I wanted a project that forces me to dive deep into Embedded Rust and the `embassy-rs` framework. Managing two separate communication interfaces (UART and USB), driving PWM servos, reading an I2C display, controlling Neopixel LEDs, and handling external interrupts for the encoder at the same time is the perfect scenario to learn and apply asynchronous programming and safe task synchronization in Rust.



## Architecture



The project revolves around the **STM32 NUCLEO-U545RE-Q** microcontroller acting as the central state machine.

* **Inputs:** The HC-05 module receives serial data strings from a Python script on the PC. The Rotary Encoder sends EXTI signals to navigate the menu.
* **Processing:** Using *embassy-executor*, independent tasks run concurrently. Data is passed safely between these tasks using *embassy-sync* Channels.
* **Outputs:** The STM32 calculates PWM duty cycles to move the servo needles, formats text to the OLED via I2C, triggers GPIO pins for the buzzer and vibration motor, updates the RGB LEDs, and sends standard USB HID keyboard reports.

## Log



### Week 5

Defined the project's core idea and established the general system direction: a physical telemetry dashboard. Researched communication protocols between the PC and STM32 (UART via Bluetooth and USB HID) and drafted the initial architecture documentation. Placed the order for the STM32 development board.



### Week 6-7

Finalized the list of remaining hardware components (OLED, servo motors, encoder, HC-06 module) and ordered them. While waiting for delivery, I studied the Embassy framework documentation for Rust and created the first theoretical pinout and connection diagrams.



### Week 8-9

Since the hardware components are still in transit, I focused on planning and documentation. I configured the GitHub repository, finalized the documentation for Milestone 1, and began working on the 3D enclosure design to ensure it is ready for printing once the physical parts arrive for final measurements.



### Week 10-11
Received the physical components and successfully assembled the complete hardware circuit on the breadboard, including the custom driving circuit for the haptic motor. Validated the electrical connections and successfully tested the I2C communication with the OLED and the PWM signal generation for the servo motors. On the software side, completed approximately 80% of the embedded Rust firmware using the `embassy-rs` framework, establishing the core asynchronous task structure and peripheral initialization. The final 3D-printed enclosure and the final software refinements are the remaining steps.



### Week 12-13
Focused heavily on the software implementation and the mechanical design of the enclosure. On the software side, the embedded Rust firmware is now approximately 85% complete. The core asynchronous tasks utilizing the `embassy-rs` framework are fully functional: the UART Bluetooth task successfully receives and parses PC telemetry, the hardware PWM channels accurately drive the servo gauges, and the I2C OLED display updates dynamically based on the rotary encoder's menu state. The logic for the visual (WS2812B) and haptic alarms is also fully integrated. Only a few minor software tweaks and fine-tuning remain.

On the mechanical side, I successfully finished designing the custom 3D enclosure in Blender. Utilizing the precise caliper measurements taken previously, I employed non-destructive Boolean modifiers to ensure a perfect fit for the STM32 Nucleo board, the breadboard, the OLED screen, and the front-panel analog gauges.

## Hardware



The system architecture relies on the **STM32 NUCLEO-U545RE-Q** as the central processing unit, interfacing with multiple peripherals across distinct communication protocols. The setup utilizes I2C for the SSD1306 OLED, asynchronous UART for the HC-06 Bluetooth module, hardware PWM channels for the SG90 analog gauges, and EXTI interrupts for the rotary encoder.

Power management is strictly divided into two rails. A **5V power rail** supplies the high-current components (HC-06 module, WS2812B LED stick, and the servo motors) directly from the USB source to prevent brownouts. A secondary **3.3V logic rail** safely powers the display, the encoder, and the STM32 logic core.

While most digital modules interface directly with the STM32 GPIO pins, the 3V coin vibration motor draws significantly more current than a standard microcontroller pin can safely source. To solve this, I designed a low-side switching circuit: the MCU outputs a control signal to the base of a **2N2222 NPN transistor** via a 1kΩ resistor. Furthermore, a **1N4007 flyback diode** is placed in parallel with the motor's inductive load to suppress high-voltage spikes (back-EMF) and protect the microcontroller.


## Schematics
The complete electrical circuit was designed using KiCad EDA, detailing all net labels, power rails, and the custom haptic driving circuit.

**Note:** The system is currently in the functional prototyping phase. The final step of the hardware development involves migrating these components from the breadboard into a custom-designed, 3D-printed desktop enclosure.
