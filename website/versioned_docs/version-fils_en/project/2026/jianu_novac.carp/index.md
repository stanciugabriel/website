## Description

An RC car controlled via Wi-Fi from a mobile phone, designed to jump approximately 75cm (average desk height) and land safely to perform a physical USB injection attack on a target laptop.The design may resemble a monster truck toy to "camouflage" better. 


## Motivation

Initially, I wanted to build a cybersecurity-oriented project,because i am quiete pasionate of the subject, but I also wanted it to be flashy. My first ideas were a bizarre hardware token or a Wi-Fi IDS monitor, but they weren't exciting enough. Then I remembered the Jumper from Watch Dogs 2 and decided to build something inspired by it.
## Architecture

Add here the schematics with the architecture of your project. Make sure to include:

- what are the main components (architecture components, not hardware components)
- how they connect with each other

## Log

### Week 20 - 25 April
- ordered online 99% of all the components .I need to find a place that sells industrial springs strong enough to jump a 1 kg RC car into air 
- brainstormed ideas for the jump mechanism 
- a few roughs sketches on paper for now 
### Week 5 - 11 May
- learned fusion 360 , finished 90% percent of the 3d render, only the injection mechanism and the camera cage are unfinished.
- printed the base layer of the car, dropped it on the ground, it broke , 
- decide to print it again and do some modification to add some resistance. 
- started writing the code for the control of the motors 
- soldered my picos

### Week 12 - 18 May

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

SImple rc car, uses a simple hardware setup, keeping in mind the shocks  it will suffer from jumping.
Control : Raspberry PI Pico W , while the ESP32-CAM provides live video 
Jumping mech : high torque JGA25 motor compresses a steel spring , released by the MG996R servo latch.
Drive : 4x TT motors with custom 3D-printed tpu wheels for traction and shock absorption.
Power: Gens Ace LiPo Battery regulated by an XL4015 5A Buck converter to keep the servos and logic rails stable during the jumps.
Sensing: VL54L0X measuring altitude and MPU6059 monitors stability and landing orientation 
Inject:MG90S servo deploys the usb.
