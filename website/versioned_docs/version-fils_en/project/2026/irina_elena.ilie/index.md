## Description

This project consists of an interactive robotic flower built using an STM32 microcontroller and programmed in Rust. The system combines mechanical movement, sensor input, and user interaction in a compact and visually engaging design. The flower reacts to nearby users and ambient sound, creating a dynamic and responsive behavior.

## Motivation

The main motivation behind this project is to explore how embedded systems can be used to create interactive and expressive physical objects. The idea was inspired by combining simple robotics with creative design, resulting in a system that behaves in a natural and engaging way. Additionally, the project aims to develop practical skills in microcontroller programming, sensor integration, and real-time system behavior.

## Architecture 

The system is based on a modular architecture centered around the STM32 microcontroller. The system behavior is implemented using a finite state machine that manages interaction and audio-reactive responses.

Main components:
- Input module (ultrasonic sensor, sound sensor)
- Processing module (STM32 microcontroller)
- Output module (servo motors, OLED display)

Connections:
- Sensors send data to the microcontroller
- The microcontroller processes the input signals
- Based on the processed data, it controls the servo motors and the display
