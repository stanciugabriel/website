## Description

Sorty is a smart conveyor belt system that automatically sorts objects based on their properties, such as color, weight, height, and whether they contain metal. The system uses different sensors to detect these characteristics and an STM32 microcontroller to process the data . It uses a series of servo-motors to push the objects into a box which corresponds to their properties . 

## Motivation

I chose this project because conveyor belts are used in many real-life applications like factories, airports, supermarkets and many others.To increase the difficulty of the project, I decided to improve a simple conveyor belt by adding sensors and an automatic sorting system, so it can detect and classify objects based on different properties. Also it seemed interesting to try and build one from scratch .

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->
### Week 21 - 27 April

 Ordered most of the sensors and motors needed for the project.
 Thought of a few ways of implementing the project.

### Week 28 April - 4 May

### Week 5 - 11 May

### Week 12 - 18 May

### Week 19 - 25 May

## Hardware

STM32U545 (NUCLEO): The microcontroller .
Buck Converter (12V → 5V): Powers the STM32 and low-voltage components.
Stepper Motor + Driver: Drives the conveyor belt.
Servo Motors (x2): Used for sorting or gate control.
Sensors: Color sensor (TCS34725), metal detector, weight sensor (load cell + HX711), and distance sensor for object detection.
User Interface: LEDs, buttons, and buzzer for feedback and control.
