## Description

This project is a smart lockbox controlled by an STM32 Nucleo board.
The user enters a PIN on a 3x4 keypad. If the PIN is correct, an SG90 servo unlocks the box. If it is wrong, access is denied and a passive buzzer gives warning feedback.

I also use a mechanical endstop to detect when the lid is closed, so the lock can return automatically to the locked position.
For the extended version, I added an ESP32 for network logging and a possible admin reset flow for the PIN.

## Motivation

I chose this project because it is practical and also a good embedded Rust challenge.
It combines hardware and software in one system: keypad input, control logic, servo actuation, sensor feedback, and communication.
I also wanted to build something physical that I can test and improve step by step.

## Architecture

Main architecture components:
- Input: 3x4 keypad, admin button, mechanical endstop.
- Main control: STM32 Nucleo (rental) running the lock logic and state machine.
- Output: SG90 servo for lock movement, LCD1602 (I2C) for messages, passive buzzer for alerts.
- Network side: ESP32 DevKitC for logging and possible admin reset/dashboard.
- Wiring setup: STM32 connects through a 7x9 interface protoboard (female headers), then to a second 7x9 main protoboard where modules are connected.

How components connect:
- Keypad, button, and endstop send inputs to the STM32.
- STM32 controls the servo, buzzer, and LCD.
- ESP32 communicates with STM32 over serial/UART for logging/admin features.
- Components are assembled on two 7x9 protoboard/PCB prototyping boards using silicone stranded wires.

### Software State Machine

The software is organized as a state machine with the following states:
- `LOCKED`
- `ENTERING_PIN`
- `UNLOCKED`
- `WAIT_FOR_CLOSE`
- `ADMIN_MODE`
- `ALARM`

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 4-5
Researched smart lockbox implementations and decided on the final project direction. Chose the main architecture around STM32 + keypad + servo and started the documentation page.

### Week 6-7
Updated the hardware plan and replaced several components: breadboard with protoboard, 4x4 keypad with 3x4 keypad, reed switch with mechanical endstop, and active buzzer with passive buzzer. Ordered all required parts and checked compatibility.

### Week 8
Defined the interface-board approach to avoid soldering on the rental STM32 board (female header bridge through a dedicated 7x9 protoboard). Added ESP32 networking scope for event logging and possible admin PIN reset flow.

## Hardware

The lockbox prototype uses a mixed setup with reusable university hardware and purchased modules.
The STM32 board is provided by the university as free rental (must be returned after project completion).
The rest of the circuit is assembled using two 7x9 protoboard/PCB prototyping boards and silicone stranded wires.
