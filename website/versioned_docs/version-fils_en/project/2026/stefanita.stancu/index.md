## Description

This project implements an IoT-based agriculture monitoring system that collects environmental data from field sensors, transmits it over LoRaWAN, and makes it accessible through a web application for visualization.

## Motivation

I particularly choose this project because it offers a solution to my personal problems, and I figured out it may help other agriculture-oriented tech enthusiasts.

## Architecture

The system follows a layered IoT architecture composed of multiple interconnected components responsible for data collection, transmission, processing, and visualization.

**Main Components** :
Data Acquisition Layer (Sensor Node)

Responsible for collecting environmental data from field sensors and preparing it for transmission.

**Communication Layer (LoRaWAN Network)**

Handles long-range wireless transmission of data from the sensor node to the network infrastructure via LoRaWAN.
Network Server (TTN)

Manages device authentication, payload decoding, and routing of data to external services.

**Backend Layer**

Processes incoming data, stores it in a database, and exposes it through APIs for further use.

**Application Layer (Web Interface)**

Provides a user-friendly interface for real-time monitoring and visualization of environmental data.

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->

### Week 5 - 6

Finalized component research and ordered all necessary hardware. Waiting for delivery.
Already had the microcontroller, some dummy thermistor and photoresistor and started testing software.

### Week 8 - 9

Soldered the sensors on the protoboard, RFM95(Lora module) didn't arrived yet. Finished KiCad schematic.

### Week 10 - 11

Soldered wires on LoRa module, wired every component, had a bit of trouble so the antenna is going to be an 8.6 cm copper wire.

**Hardware Used**
STM32 microcontroller, environmental sensors ( temperature, humidity, light ), LoRa transceiver (RFM96), and a LoRa gateway for wireless data transmission(the gateway is a public one which is hosted on TTN).
