## Description

A standalone embedded security device built on the NUCLEO-U545RE-Q microcontroller. You plug it into your PC via USB and scan your fingerprint to unlock it. A rotary encoder lets you scroll through a menu of accounts on an OLED display. Selecting an account either injects the stored password directly into your PC (acting as a USB HID keyboard) or shows a live, expiring 6-digit TOTP code derived from HMAC-SHA1 cryptography. A hardware real-time clock ensures the TOTP timestamps are always accurate, even after the device has been powered off.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project was to create a dedicated, self-contained physical key for passwords and 2FA, bypassing the need for phone-based authenticators. From an engineering standpoint, it offered a compelling system integration challenge: tying together async Rust with Embassy, USB HID communication, and constrained cryptography on the STM32 platform to deliver a responsive, standalone tool.

## Log

### Week 4 (Idea Research)

- Explored the concept of a dedicated hardware security device as the project theme.
- Initially considered a password manager and a TOTP generator as two separate projects, then decided to merge them into a single integrated device, a biometric hardware key.
- Researched existing commercial solutions (YubiKey, Nitrokey, Ledger for crypto) for inspiration on scope and feature set.

### Week 5 (Component Research & Procurement)

- Researched all required hardware components: microcontroller, fingerprint sensor, OLED display, RTC module, rotary encoder, and battery.
- Compared alternatives for each component (e.g. internal RTC vs DS3231 external module, I2C vs SPI display).
- Placed purchase orders for all components.

### Week 6 (Components Arrive - Initial Testing)

- All components arrived; began a first testing phase powered via USB only (no battery yet).
- Verified I2C bus connectivity for the SH1106 OLED and DS3231 RTC on PB7 (SDA) and PB6 (SCL).
- Verified GPIO connectivity for the EC11 rotary encoder on PA0 (CLK), PA1 (DT), and PA4 (SW).

### Week 7 (Extended Testing - Known Issues)

- Continued testing and identified the following issues to address before final integration:
  1. **Fingerprint sensor wiring** - The AS608 module arrived with a pre-crimped connector head; the wires cannot be inserted directly into a breadboard. A connector adapter or manual re-crimping is required before it can be wired to the MCU.
  2. **MCU power source** - To run from the 9V Li-ion battery instead of USB, the NUCLEO onboard jumper must be moved from the `STLK` position to `VIN 5V`.
  3. **External RTC** - Switching to the DS3231 external RTC module to ensure accurate timestamps at all times even when the device is switched off or loses power.
  4. *(Optional)* **External USB-C module** - Soldering an external USB-C breakout would allow cleaner cable management and a more polished physical build.
  5. **External EEPROM Module** - Exploring the possibility of not using the internal flash, and instead adding an external EEPROM Module to store the hashed passwords.

### Week 8 (Integration Progress)

- Continued the first integration steps and made the following updates:
  1. **Fingerprint sensor wiring** - Soldered the AS608 wires.
  2. **External EEPROM module** - Purchased an EEPROM module, but decided to use the internal flash as the main storage option and keep the EEPROM as a backup.
  3. **USB connectivity** - Dropped the USB-C breakout board idea and switched to using the STM32 User USB port for PC - MCU communication.
  4. **Firmware testing** - Extended the component testing code.
  5. **New issue** - Battery wires need to be soldered before use.
  
  ### Week 9 (Development)

- Started the actual development:
1. **Testing** -  Wrote test code for the display, RTC Module and Rotary Encoder.
2. **Documentation** - Documented the crates that needed to be added for more security.

### Week 10 (Development)

- Continued the development process:
1. **Testing** - Added test modules and helpers for the fingerprint sensor.
2. **App flow** - Designed a State machine (Locked -> MenuBrowse -> ActionMenu -> ShowTotp) for the main use flow.

### Week 11 (Development)

- Continued the development process:
1. **Main** - Finalized the first main prototype, a flow that integrates all sensors and is a skeleton for future improvements.
2. **Power** - Removed the external battery (after soldering the cables and testing it) as the main power source. Instead, the device will receive power via USB.
3. **To do** - Improve security, add memory protection and data verification.

### Week 12 (Development)

- Continued the development process:
1. **Main** - Implemented memory protection, better security and data verification. Added a host CLI to send data through the terminal to the device.
2. **3D Design** - Created a 3D Box render to store all of the components, making it a true embedded device.
3. **To do** - Create a desktop app with GUI for easier usage. Improve overall app flow.

### Week 13 (Development)

- Continued the development process:
1. **Desktop App** - Added the desktop app that uses the host to add and update account details on the device.
2. **3D Print** - Printed the 3D Box and fit the components inside. The middle "floor" had to be removed because the cables did not fit properly.
3. **To do** - Improve the app flow, add UI animations.

### Week 14 (Finishing touches)

- Finalized the development process:
1. **In progress** - Updating the main code.

## Hardware

The project centres on a NUCLEO-U545RE-Q development board as the microcontroller. An AS608 optical fingerprint sensor handles biometric authentication over UART. A 1.3" SH1106 OLED display and a DS3231 RTC module share the I2C bus, the RTC keeps accurate time for TOTP generation even while unplugged, backed by a coin-cell battery. An EC11 rotary encoder with integrated push-button provides all navigation input via GPIO. A 9V 3700 mWh Li-ion rechargeable battery makes the device fully portable. Everything is wired on a breadboard with jumper wires and supporting passives. An optional future goal is implementing ARM TrustZone to secure cryptographic operations and password storage.

**NUCLEO-U545RE-Q (Central Hub)** - Runs the async Rust firmware (embassy-stm32). Stores password strings and TOTP secret seeds in flash, orchestrates all peripherals, computes HMAC-SHA1 hashes, and drives the USB HID stack.

**AS608 Fingerprint Sensor** - Connected over UART. The device stays in a locked idle state until a recognised fingerprint is presented. On a match, it signals the MCU to unlock the vault.
- *Connection*: UART TX/RX to USART peripheral on the NUCLEO board.

**SH1106 OLED Display (1.3")** - Shows the lock screen, the scrollable account list, and live TOTP codes.
- *Connection*: I2C (SDA/SCL) shared bus with the RTC module.

**DS3231 Real-Time Clock** - Provides a precise Unix timestamp at all times, even when the device is unplugged, via its onboard coin-cell backup.
- *Connection*: I2C (SDA/SCL) shared bus with the OLED display.

**EC11 Rotary Encoder (with push-button)** - The sole physical input. Rotating scrolls the account menu; pressing selects an account to either inject a password or display a TOTP code.
- *Connection*: Three GPIO pins (CLK, DT, SW).

**USB HID (to host PC)** - The NUCLEO's USB port enumerates as a composite HID keyboard device. When a password injection is triggered, the firmware sends keystrokes directly to the connected computer.
