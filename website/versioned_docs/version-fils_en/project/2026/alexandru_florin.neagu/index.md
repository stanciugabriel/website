## Description

This project represents a **3-axis camera stabilizer** designed to keep a relatively small DSLR/Mirrorless camera steady while the user is moving - My **Canon EOS R camera** paired with an **EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II Canon lens** (total weight: ~1kg). 

The stabilizer uses an STM32 NUCLEO-U545RE-Q development board, an IMU sensor, brushless motors, motor drivers, a joystick and a LiPo battery.

## Motivation

I chose this project because I am currently learning videography and cinematography and the prices of camera equipment are simply too much for a freelancing student (even more than the price of the standalone components, *huh, that's unbelievable!*, **I know**, until you search for how much actually good equipment costs). As such, I have started on a quest of creating my own personal equipment, starting with maybe the most important tool - stabilization (because my hands aren't the steadiest out there and it makes a world of difference on film).

## Architecture 

This is the initial diagram, subject to change as I develop the project, regarding how I think my project should be organized/work:

These are the current KiCAD diagrams for the project depicting the power distribution and the different protocols used for communication inbetween the STM32 board and the separate peripherals (The motor driver & encoder combos, the IMU, the joystick control, the screen and an additional vibration motor)

## Log

<!-- write your progress here every week -->
### Week 6: 30 March - 6 April

Coming up with possible project ideas.

### Week 7: 6 - 12 April

Conceptual stage, thinking how I would want my gimbal project to work, coming up with ideas regarding components and spending a **lot** of time looking for correct/compatible components, as I think this project is a bit complex for my current level of understading.

### Week 8: 12 - 18 April

Ordering a big part of components (motors, drivers+encoders, STM32 board). More research.

### Week 9: 19 - 25 April

Ordering next batch of components (IMU, battery and charger). More research x2. Changed to attempting CAN connection (lord have mercy).

### Week 10: 26 April - 2 May

Arrival of most components. Realised I need for the CAN bus a twisted pair insulated wire, had lots of trouble finding some available in Romania till I found some and ordered. Started working on the 3D printed components, the motor magnet couplings, the driver cages and the arms, alongside prototyping ways for cable management in Fusion 360.

### Week 11: 3 - 9 May

Finished designing the driver cages, still working on the rest of the components. Cable arrived. Realised my drivers have small can cables which I need to further connect to perfboards to fulfill CAN Bus conditions. Starting thinking about the KiCAD schematic and the different communication protocols required for pin connections between the board and the peripherals.

### Week 12: 10 - 16 May

Finished the KiCAD schematic and submitted to Git branch for review by lab assistants. Worked on setting up motor drivers and motors with USB-C connection and integrated ODrive Python programs developed for MKS XDRive Mini. Still working on 3D design for arms and rails for coupling the 3 axis components.

## Hardware

Hardware used for creating this project (list currently WIP): STM32 NUCLEO-U545RE-Q, GM5208-24 motors, MKS XDRIVE MINI drivers with AS5047P on board, ICM-20948 IMU, LiPo GENS ACE G-Tech Soaring 4S 14.8 V 2200mA battery with appropriate charger and 2 Axis Joystick. Photos of components will be added after they arrive (currently still being delivered).
