## Description

The **Theremin Sound Station** is an embedded audio system that allows users modify the basic audio equiliser parameters without touching it. By combining Time-of-Flight (ToF) distance sensing and gesture recognition, the device acts as a digital equaliser and controller. The right hand selects which part of the frequency spectrum to modify via gestures (left, right etc.), while the left hand's height (distance) determines the intensity of the change. 

The system reads `.wav` files from a microSD card, decodes them via an I2S DAC, and provides visual feedback through an LCD display and a 16-LED Neopixel ring. It also transmites the signal changes through a usb to a computer in order to display the wave.

## Motivation

As a 2nd-year student passionate about music and sound engineering, I wanted to combine my interest in unique musical instruments (like the Theremin) with embedded systems. I also want to be a sound engineer or design sound systems once I finish university, because I'm extreamly passionate about signal processing and sounds.

## Architecture

The project is built on the STM32 Nucleo U545RE-Q using the Embassy asynchronous framework.

## Log

### Week 30 March - 5 April
* Initial project proposal and research into Rust embedded ecosystem.
* Acquired the STM32 Nucleo U545RE-Q board.
* Set up the Rust toolchain (probe-rs, thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf).
* Bought required hardware.

### Week 13 - 19 April 
* Soldered extension pins to the sensors.
* Reseached SAI pins.

### Week 20 - 26 April 
* Reserched equilizer logic and perfboards for prototyping
* Re-soldered pins at 90 degrees.

### Week 4 - 10 May
* Made a fully functioning hardware.
* Made KiCad schematic.
* Tested the sensor creates (they work).

## Hardware

The project uses a modular design with three "Sound Cubes" to separate sensors from the main control unit, preventing interference.
